Only the use of cranberry for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women is supported by some scientific evidence. The efficacy of other commonly used herbal medications has not been proven. For instance, the beneficial effect of St John’s wort for short-term treatment of mild to moderate depression is still debated. Use of Echinacea for treatment of colds is not supported by scientific data. Similarly, there is questionable evidence on the efficacy of ginseng, which is often used to improve physical and cognitive performance. Ginkgo biloba has been marketed to improve memory and cognitive performance, but there is no consistent scientific evidence to support this use. The efficacy of garlic in lowering cholesterol levels, treating hypertension, and reducing cardiovascular risk is uncertain. Furthermore, no beneficial effect has been attributed to ginger for treatment of nausea or to soy for control of menopausal symptoms.Herbal medications can mistakenly be perceived as safe because they are natural products. They may produce negative effects such as allergic reactions, rashes, asthma, headaches, dizziness, agitation, dry mouth, seizures, fatigue, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Severe side effects have also been reported. Cases of hepatotoxicity (liver damage) were reported for kava kava and life-threatening anaphylactic reactions have been reported for most herbal medications. Herbal medications may also modify the effect of conventional medications. For example, cranberry and Ginkgo biloba should be used cautiously by people who take blood-thinning medications (such as warfarin or aspirin) because of an increased risk of bleeding. St John’s wort interferes with the effect of many medications, including birth control pills, antidepressants, and anti-HIV medications. Also, the active ingredients of many herbal medications are not readily known, and contamination has been reported.Conflict of Interest Disclosures: All authors have completed and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest and none were reported.Source: National Center for Complementary and Integrative HealthTopic: Complementary and Alternative Medicine","year":"2016","createdAt":"2020-10-26T00:07:50.278Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-26T00:07:50.278Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f96135625109f1b986f0be2","title":"Editor's Correspondence: COMMENTS AND OPINIONS","link":"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/224592?resultClick=1","abstract":"In replyWe thank Bollu et al for their reaction to our article on the HARM study.1 They wonder whether we have given consideration to the Beers list in our study.

Currently, the United States does not regulate herbal products, as they are considered dietary supplements. Therefore, there is no standardization of active ingredients, purity, or concentration. There are also no regulations governing which herbs can be marketed for various ailments. This has made learning about and using these treatments challenging.

Chinese herbal medicines have been widely prescribed for HCV in Asia, and many infected patients in the United States have used these agents. However, data to support the efficacy of these medications are limited and, to our knowledge, no published trials have been conducted in a US population.Methods&nbsp; In a double-blinded design, 45 patients with HCV and fatigue were randomized to receive a combination of Chinese herbal medications or a matched placebo for 12 weeks. The main outcome measures were changes in health-related quality of life using the role physical and vitality scale scores from the validated Hepatitis Quality of Life Questionnaire and alanine aminotransferase levels. In addition, other Hepatitis Quality of Life Questionnaire variables, HCV load, and adverse effects were monitored.Results&nbsp; In patients with HCV, the herbal medications had no effect on any quality-of-life variables, as measured by the Hepatitis Quality of Life Questionnaire. In addition, no significant changes in alanine aminotransferase or serum HCV RNA levels were noted. No significant adverse effects were observed.Conclusions&nbsp; In this study, a regimen of Chinese herbal medicines did not improve quality of life, liver chemistry results, or viral load in a cohort of patients with HCV. Patients and practitioners should remain cautious about the use of herbal medicines for HCV, because studies have not shown a clear benefit of these agents.Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become the most frequent cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States and western Europe.1,2 The prevalence of HCV is estimated to be 1.8% in the United States, with significantly higher rates in some demographic groups.3 Although the incidence of new infections is declining, estimates suggest that the number of patients with HCV-related cirrhosis and cancer will increase during the next decade.1 Therapy of HCV involves the use of injectable interferon along with oral ribavirin, which will eradicate the infection in approximately 50% of treated patients.4 However, interferon-ribavirin therapy can have significant adverse effects that limit its use in some patients, particularly those with hematologic, renal, cardiac, or psychiatric disease.5 Thus, many HCV carriers will either fail to clear the virus or be intolerant of available therapy.In addition to symptoms of advanced liver disease, which occur in a minority of patients with HCV,6 several reports7-9 have found a high prevalence of fatigue and other nonspecific symptoms. As a group, patients with HCV demonstrate a lower health-related quality of life compared with either healthy patients or patients with other forms of liver disease.10-13 Aside from viral eradication using interferon-based therapy, data on treatments for reducing fatigue and enhancing quality of life in HCV patients are lacking.The absence of reliably effective therapy for HCV, coupled with the popularity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), has led to increased use of botanical compounds to treat this condition.14,15 Because of the unregulated availability of these agents, there are no accurate data about their use among HCV patients in this country. Furthermore, data regarding the efficacy of these agents are sparse. Although a few studies16 from the Asia Pacific region suggest a possible benefit of traditional Chinese medicine compounds, to our knowledge, no controlled trials have been performed in a US population. We, therefore, performed a short-term pilot study to examine the efficacy and safety of a combination of Chinese herbal medicines in patients with HCV and fatigue. Our results suggest no therapeutic benefit of these agents in regard to standard measures of virologic response or health-related quality of life.This was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study of a fixed combination of Chinese herbal medicines in patients with HCV and fatigue. The study was conducted at a single center. The Institutional Review Board at Hennepin County Medical Center approved the protocol and informed consent process. The Food and Drug Administration Investigational New Drug application process was completed before beginning the administration of the herbal agents.Individuals with confirmed HCV who were aged 18 to 70 years were considered eligible for the study. All participants had been previously examined for HCV by their physicians and had been offered referral to specialists for interferon therapy. Participants were recruited through clinics and local advertising. After a telephone interview to assess eligibility, potential participants were asked to schedule an intake visit. During the intake visit, eligibility was established and written consent was obtained. Inclusion criteria were confirmed HCV (with detectable serum HCV RNA), an elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (≥57 and ≤350 U/L) within 6 months of enrollment, and fatigue with a perceived lower quality of life. Participants with other forms of liver disease, recent antiviral treatment (within 3 months of screening), or current alcohol consumption greater than 2 standard drinks daily (42 g [1.5 oz], 80 proof; 336 g [12 oz], 5% beer; or 140 g [5 oz], 12%-17% wine) were excluded. Forty-five eligible participants consented, and were randomized into 2 treatment arms by random number assignment and stratified by sex.Before initiating the study, participants stopped using all other herbs and dietary supplements for 3 weeks. Participants randomized to active treatment received a fixed combination of 10 traditional Chinese medicinal herbs, 10 g/d, that contained the following components: Radix astragali (6%), Radix acanthopanax (8%), Radix bupleuir (8%), Radix et tuber curcumae (10%), Rhizoma polygonum (10%), Radix glycyrrhiza (4%), Radix isatis (14%), Radix paeoniae rubra (14%), Radix salviae (14%), and Herba taraxaci (12%). Participants in the control arm consumed an equivalent amount of a similar-appearing and similar-tasting placebo. The treatment and placebo remedies were administered orally in the form of 7 tablets 2 times a day for 12 weeks. Kaiser Pharmaceuticals Company Products, Inc, Tainan, Taiwan, performed high-performance liquid chromatography of each component and the final mixture to ensure appropriate levels of constituent ingredients. Formulation Technology, Oakdale, Calif, a Food and Drug Administration–approved facility, made the herbal compound and the placebo into a tablet. All study personnel were blinded with regard to treatment assignment. The study nurse (S.M.C.) distributed bottles of medication prelabeled with participant identification numbers by the study coordinator (T.A.B.); the study coordinator was also responsible for randomization and had no patient contact.After the intake visit, participants were seen by a nurse (S.M.C.) or physician (M.J.) on the day of treatment initiation (week 0), at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 during treatment, and at weeks 16 and 20 posttreatment. At each visit, participants were asked about tolerance and potential adverse effects, and a blood test was performed to obtain liver chemistry results, electrolyte levels, and renal function results. Blood cell counts were obtained at weeks 4 and 12 and at 8 weeks posttreatment. The prothrombin time was determined at intake and at week 8. Each participant underwent electrocardiography at intake, week 8, and 8 weeks posttreatment. Compliance was assessed by pill counts at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Participants were considered compliant if they consumed an average of 7 g/d (9.8 pills per day). Clinic physicians (M.J. and J.H.A.) reviewed participant records throughout the study. The modified World Health Organization guidelines were used in assessing abnormal laboratory results (for sodium, potassium, total carbon dioxide, glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, total protein, albumin, aspartate, ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels),17 and participants experiencing events of grade 3 or 4 discontinued the treatment. In addition, participants discontinued the treatment if their ALT levels exceeded 350 U/L.The principal quantitative measures in this study were Hepatitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (HQLQ) scores and ALT levels. Additional measures included HCV polymerase chain reaction and genotyping results. The HCV load was measured with a polymerase chain reaction ultraquantitative method using a commercially available kit (COBAS AMPLICOR HCV MONITOR Test, v2.0; Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, Ind). Viral genotypes were determined by molecular sequencing using the same kit.Participant symptoms were measured using the standardized HQLQ. The HQLQ, based on the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, is a 69-item, validated, self-administered questionnaire consisting of 10 multi-item scales that measure generic functioning, well-being, and disease-specific health outcomes in participants with chronic HCV (Quality-Metric, Inc, Lincoln, RI).18 A higher score correlates with improved function or quality of life. This instrument has been used by several groups12,13,18 to evaluate quality of life in patients with HCV. The HQLQ was administered at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 and at 8 weeks posttreatment.The primary end points in this study were as follows: (1) the HQLQ role physical and vitality scale scores at 8 weeks compared with baseline (week 0) and (2) the ALT levels at 12 weeks compared with baseline. To estimate sample size, we assumed a treatment effect δ of 25 in role physical scores and 18 in vitality scores between the placebo and herbal medicine groups, based on the response seen in previous studies10 of successful HCV treatment with interferon. Powered at 0.8 (β = .2) with a .05 α level, the calculation indicated a total sample size of 40. The secondary end points of the study were physical and mental component summary scale scores from the HQLQ at 8 weeks compared with baseline, role physical and vitality scale scores at 4 and 12 weeks compared with baseline, ALT level at 4 and 8 weeks compared with baseline, and polymerase chain reaction RNA viral load at 12 weeks compared with baseline (intake). The categorical HQLQ variables and the continuous variables of ALT level and polymerase chain reaction RNA viral load were analyzed using t tests and a repeated-measures analysis of variance. Data analysis was conducted after all the participants completed the study. All analyses were conducted using the principle of intention to treat; all participants randomized were included in the final analysis. Analysis was conducted using a commercially available software program (SPSS for Windows, version 6.0.1; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). To normalize the data for statistical analysis and to simplify reporting of the viral load, the results were run as a log transformation and then geometric means were calculated.Of the 427 participants screened for this study, 82 met the initial eligibility criteria, and 45 of these consented and underwent randomization. Reasons for exclusion from the study included lack of HCV symptoms, such as an elevated ALT level and fatigue, and participation in other hepatitis-related clinical trials (eg, pegylated interferon). Of the 45 participants randomized, 37 completed week 12 of the study. Thirty-one participants finished both posttreatment follow-up visits. Of the 31 participants who completed the exit interview, 21 (68%) incorrectly guessed their treatment arm. Baseline participant characteristics are shown in Table 1.Initial mean ± SE ALT values were 139.4 ± 73.5 U/L and 122.0 ± 57.7 U/L in the herbal medicine and placebo groups, respectively (P = .39). The ALT values did not significantly change during the 12-week course of the treatment, and were not different at any time between the 2 groups (Figure 1). The HCV load was also unchanged after 12 weeks of therapy. No significant changes were noted in other liver enzyme test results, prothrombin time, cell counts, or renal function during the study (data not shown).No significant differences in HQLQ scores were observed from baseline in either group (Figure 2). At no point did HQLQ scores improve for any single scale compared with baseline, and no differences between the placebo and treatment groups were observed. A further analysis was performed using sex as a covariate, and again no significant differences were noted.The study nurse monitored adverse effects at each visit under the supervision of the clinic physician. The modified World Health Organization guidelines were used to evaluate adverse events.17 A self-report symptom questionnaire was administered at every visit. Although most participants did have some adverse events (19 [86%] of the 22 participants in the placebo group vs 19 [83%] of the 23 participants in the active treatment group; P>.99), the overall incidence of adverse events was not significantly different (29 in the placebo group vs 27 in the active treatment group; P = .42) between the 2 groups (Table 2), and events were typically mild. This was in part because of stringent criteria used to define adverse events. Gastrointestinal complaints, such as gas, bloating, and loose stools, occurred slightly more often in the treatment group, and sleep-related events, such as increased fatigue and insomnia, occurred more frequently in the placebo group. With the exception of the mild gastrointestinal complaints, the evidence does not suggest that the adverse events reported were related to the treatment regimen. Clinical reports19 suggest that mild gastrointestinal events are often attributed to the consumption of botanicals.During the study, 3 participants discontinued because their ALT levels were elevated above 350 U/L. However, spontaneous flares of transaminase elevations are frequently observed in patients with HCV, and a review of the patients did not suggest a hepatotoxic reaction to the herbal agents (Table 3). The participant with the highest ALT elevation during treatment was receiving placebo. In the other 2 participants, a substantial increase in ALT level was noted between the intake visit and treatment initiation, suggesting that these participants may have experienced spontaneous flares of inflammatory activity. Of the 5 participants who voluntarily withdrew during the study, 2 stated that adverse events had influenced the decision; both participants were in the placebo group. Of the other 3 participants, one cited personal problems unrelated to the study, another decided to begin treatment with interferon, and the third did not provide an explanation. In summary, aside from mild gastrointestinal symptoms, no significant adverse effects of the herbal treatment were observed.At weeks 4, 8, and 12, the number of patients who were compliant with therapy were 39 (86.7%), 37 (82.2%), and 31 (68.9%), respectively. There were no significant differences in either overall or degree of compliance between the active treatment group and placebo.The HCV epidemic has resulted in a significant disease burden in the United States, and has had a substantial impact on mortality, morbidity, quality of life, and health care costs.1,6 Although the success of interferon-based therapy has improved markedly since its introduction in the early 1990s, viral eradication cannot be achieved in many patients.4 Furthermore, these medications are costly, labor intensive, and prone to causing adverse effects.5 The development of additional safe, inexpensive, and effective therapies for HCV is, therefore, an important goal. The absence of fully acceptable therapy has led an unknown, but presumably large, number of patients to partake in CAM modalities, although data regarding safety and efficacy are largely lacking. To our knowledge, no studies have tested CAM therapies for HCV in a US population. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no prior reports have examined the effect of herbal medications on quality of life in the setting of HCV. In this study, we examined a combination of Chinese herbal medicines that have been used in Asia for the treatment of HCV. The results indicated no measurable benefit, and suggest that further investigation of herbal regimens is required before practitioners can recommend their use in HCV patients.Studies20 indicate that 40% or more of adults engage in some form of CAM therapy, generally without the supervision of a health care provider. Several CAM compounds have been shown to be effective in well-designed, randomized, controlled trials.21,22 However, for the most part, claims of efficacy or safety of botanical regimens have not been substantiated in rigorous clinical studies. This is because of several factors, including practice and education styles based on established traditions and experience, rather than a strictly evidence-based approach.21,23 In addition, CAM practitioners often use combinations of compounds that are frequently adjusted based on symptoms and findings, which is difficult to accommodate in the setting of a blinded and randomized trial. The lack of data supporting the use of CAM agents for chronic liver diseases has raised some concerns in the hepatologic literature.14 Given the widespread use of these agents, systematic trials in this patient population are warranted.16In the present study, we used a combination of Chinese herbal medicines that have been used extensively for the treatment of chronic hepatitis in Asia.16,24 The precise formulation was based on a review of the CAM literature and the Chinese training of one of us (U.B.). The regimen in this study was similar to that used in an Australian trial,24 which reported improved ALT levels in treated patients. In addition, several ingredients in the current regimen are used in popular Japanese regimens, including Sho-saiko-to (TJ-9).16 In Japan, herbal medications are prescribed frequently by physicians for HCV, particularly in patients who cannot be adequately treated with interferons.25 Studies26-29 involving Sho-saiko-to have suggested improved ALT levels and potential immunomodulatory, antifibrotic, or anticarcinogenic effects. However, a clear consensus regarding the efficacy of herbal agents in HCV patients has not emerged from the available literature.16Studies30 from Japan and Europe have suggested a possible beneficial effect of intravenous glycyrrhizin therapy in HCV patients. Several trials31,32 have shown a significant decrease in ALT levels, but this benefit diminished after treatment was discontinued and no effect on HCV viral replication was observed. Glycyrrhizin may have antifibrotic effects, although, to our knowledge, these have not been documented in a prospective clinical trial.31 A study33 from Japan suggested that long-term intravenous glycyrrhizin therapy may diminish the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in the setting of HCV. Each of these studies used intravenous administration, which presents logistical difficulties for some patients. In addition, at these higher doses, glycyrrhizin may have aldosteronelike effects, including sodium retention and edema.32 In the present study, we used a lower dose of glycyrrhizin in the oral formulation, and did not see a significant effect on ALT levels. However, glycyrrhizin seems to mediate intracellular pathways that control the inflammatory response and, therefore, further study of this agent may be warranted.30Numerous herbal agents have been reported to cause hepatotoxicity.34 The compounds used in these studies were chosen in part because of the presumed lack of hepatic adverse effects.19,35 The protocol used World Health Organization criteria for hepatic adverse effects and, in addition, patients with an ALT level higher than 350 U/L were withdrawn from the study. However, marked ALT fluctuations are commonly seen in HCV patients. In both patients who were withdrawn from the herbal arm of this study, ALT elevations occurred between the screening visit and the first dosing, indicating that these were spontaneous flares of inflammatory activity. The patient with the highest ALT level during treatment received placebo. Therefore, this study does not suggest any significant hepatotoxicity of the herbal formulation. However, because hepatotoxicity from pharmaceutical or herbal agents often occurs in a sporadic and idiosyncratic manner,14,34 providers should remain vigilant for potential adverse effects of these and other CAM therapies for HCV.The limitations of this study included the use of a fixed dosing regimen that is inconsistent with some traditional CAM practices.21,23 Furthermore, the components and doses used in this formulation differ from previous reports of HCV treatment, and the current results cannot be generalized to other herbal regimens. In addition, the individuals enrolled in this study were predominantly middle-aged white men and, thus, may not fully represent all groups of HCV patients. Finally, the small sample size in this pilot study could have only detected a large treatment effect and the stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria could have excluded patients who might have benefited from the therapy.In summary, the present study found no significant effect of the herbal regimen in regard to quality of life, liver enzyme levels, or viral load in patients with chronic HCV. Given the widespread use of medicinal herbs among patients with HCV, and reports of benefits and adverse effects of these agents in those with liver diseases, further study is warranted. It is possible that future trials will show that herbal agents are reasonable therapeutic options for patients with HCV who are refractory to interferon-based regimens. However, given the available data,16 patients and practitioners should remain cautious about the use of herbal medications in HCV patients.Corresponding author: Jeffrey H.

Patients, gastroenterologists, and herbalists were all blinded to treatment group.Main Outcome Measures.—&nbsp;Change in total bowel symptom scale scores and global improvement assessed by patients and gastroenterologists and change in the degree of interference in life caused by IBS symptoms assessed by patients.Results.—&nbsp;Compared with patients in the placebo group, patients in the active treatment groups (standard and individualized CHM) had significant improvement in bowel symptom scores as rated by patients (P = .03) and by gastroenterologists (P = .001), and significant global improvement as rated by patients (P=.007) and by gastroenterologists (P=.002). Patients reported that treatment significantly reduced the degree of interference with life caused by IBS symptoms (P=.03). Chinese herbal formulations individually tailored to the patient proved no more effective than standard CHM treatment. On follow-up 14 weeks after completion of treatment, only the individualized CHM treatment group maintained improvement.Conclusion.—&nbsp;Chinese herbal formulations appear to offer improvement in symptoms for some patients with IBS.IRRITABLE BOWEL syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder that accounts for a significant proportion of patients seen in gastroenterology offices1 and is characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain and disturbed defecation. Studies in the United States and Australia suggest that between 10% and 20% of the population have this disorder.2-5 No single available treatment is reliably effective for this condition,6,7 and patients use a variety of approaches for symptom management, including drugs, dietary modifications, and counseling.To date, no strong scientific evidence available supports the use of Chinese herbal agents in IBS.8 However, CHM has been used for centuries in the treatment of functional bowel disorders and is routinely used for this purpose in China. Several Chinese studies have suggested the potential effectiveness of CHM for treatment of IBS, although these have all lacked rigor in clinical trial protocol9-13 and have had poor randomization techniques and lack of blinding.8According to the fundamental principles of traditional Chinese medicine, treatment should be tailored to the individual clinical presentation of patients, even though they all may have the same medical diagnosis.8,14,15 Furthermore, treatment needs to be modified at different stages of the patient's illness or recovery. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of CHM in the treatment of IBS. We compared individualized therapy against a standard Chinese herbal formulation for IBS and a placebo using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design.Patients were recruited from gastroenterology units in 2 teaching hospitals in Sydney, Australia, and through 5 private practices of gastroenterologists. After patient screening and subsequent review in these centers, patients' conditions were further diagnosed (according to Chinese medicine principles) and treated in 3 Chinese herbal clinics by 3 Chinese medicine practitioners.A clinical trial notification was filed with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services, Canberra, Australia. All herbal substances used in this trial were listed with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, have been acknowledged as suitable for human consumption, and were administered within standard dosage levels. All herbs used in this trial are available over-the-counter throughout Australia. No product used in this trial was a controlled substance, animal product, or endangered species. The trial protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Western Sydney Macarthur and the ethics committees of the 2 participating hospitals.Patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years (inclusive) were screened by a gastroenterologist. Screening involved a routine clinical workup for IBS with diagnostic tests as determined appropriate by the specialist. Patients were assessed according to the Rome criteria, an established standard for diagnosis of IBS.16,17 If diarrhea was a prominent symptom, lactose intolerance was excluded by hydrogen breath testing or during a 2-week lactose exclusion period. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table 1. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before entering the trial. Patients were free to withdraw from the study at any time.After initial gastroenterological screening (week 0), all patients entered a 2-week run-in period. A Bowel Symptom Scale (BSS) was completed at the beginning and end of the 2-week period to assess measurement reliability and to account for any degree of improvement based simply on admission to the trial. Patients were seen on specified days by 1 of 3 herbalists during the trial period and were not permitted to change herbalist during the course of the treatment. The first consultation with the Chinese herbalist occurred at week 2, at which time the patient was randomized (by an assistant) to placebo, standard CHM, or individualized CHM treatment. The patient was reevaluated by the Chinese herbalist at 2-week intervals for 2 occasions and then at monthly intervals for 2 further occasions. Continuous treatment was administered for 16 weeks. No special instructions were given to patients regarding diet, other than to continue consumption of foods they felt comfortable with and to avoid foods known to cause them gastrointestinal tract irritation. All patients were evaluated by their gastroenterologist after 8 weeks of treatment and again at the end of the 16-week treatment period. Patients were closely monitored for any adverse effects or worsening of symptoms. Liver function tests were performed after 8 weeks of treatment. Follow-up questionnaires were sent to all patients 14 weeks after completion of the treatment period. Treatment codes were broken and revealed to patients only after completion of the follow-up questionnaires.Randomization was done by selection of a sealed envelope from a closed bag. Seventy sealed envelopes were prepared for each of the standard and individualized groups, and 60 envelopes were prepared for the placebo group. Patients were aware that there was a greater chance of receiving active treatment. Success in blinding was evaluated using a treatment credibility scale administered during the trial.All herbs were administered in the dried powdered form and encapsulated. A period of preparation was required before commencement of the trial to develop a suitable dispensary of 81 individual dried powdered Chinese herbs for dispensing to patients in the individualized treatment group. The standard herbal formulation was designed by Chinese herbalists and prepared by the principal supplier, Mei Yu Imports, Sydney, Australia (Table 2).18 The placebo preparation was prepared and encapsulated by a pharmaceutical contractor and was designed to taste, smell, and look similar to a Chinese herb formula. After testing on 5 independent volunteers, the placebo was deemed indistinguishable from raw powdered Chinese herbs. All herbs and the placebo formulation were supplied in the same opaque capsules. Patients in all 3 groups were required to take 5 capsules 3 times daily.After consulting with the Chinese herbalist, all patients were required to complete a series of questionnaires and wait 30 minutes for the preparation of their capsules. The wait time was used to avoid patients identifying whether they were receiving prepared capsules (standard or placebo) or individualized formulations that were made at the treatment center. All medication preparation occurred in a closed room by assistants who were restricted from contact with the patients. Treatment codes were held by these assistants and by the chief investigator (A.B.). A blinded primary research assistant managed all the questionnaires and was responsible for giving the capsules to the patients. All patients were treated in an equivalent fashion. Compliance was assessed by an item included in the BSS and by pill count.The BSS was used to assess change in IBS symptoms during the course of the treatment. The BSS consists of 100-mm visual analog scales related to each symptom of IBS (pain/discomfort, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea) and an overall severity scale. Patients and gastroenterologists completed this scale independently at the beginning and end of the treatment period. Patients also were monitored during the course of the trial using this scale. The BSS also included items for assessing rate of stool passage, rating the degree to which IBS symptoms interfered with life activities, and recording changes in medications usage and fiber consumption. To assess the success of patient blinding, a brief questionnaire was administered to patients after 2, 4, 10, and 16 weeks of treatment. This 4-item scale has been used to test credibility of different forms of psychological treatment19 but also has been successfully used in acupuncture trials and shown to have good internal consistency and test-retest reliability.20,21Pearson product moment correlation was used in the analysis of reliability and validity data, and factor analysis was used to determine construct validity of the credibility scale. Outcome measures with categorical responses were analyzed using χ2 and Fisher exact tests. For the BSS, analysis of variance was used to determine the differences among groups at baseline, end of treatment, and follow-up. All P values were 2-tailed, unless otherwise indicated, and the α level of significance was set at .05. Missing scale and item scores were not replaced. Data are presented according to an intention-to-treat protocol, in which patients who withdrew from the trial were recorded as having worsened (if appropriate) for categorical items only. Data for all other outcome measures are presented as per protocol analysis.There were no reliable data that could be used to accurately predict the anticipated effect size between placebo, standard, and individualized treatment groups. We estimated that for adequate power (80%) to detect a 20% difference on the BSS scores at the α=.05 level (1-tailed test), 35 patients were needed in each group.A total of 116 subjects were recruited during an 18-month period: 35 were randomized into the placebo group, 43 into the standard group, and 38 into the individualized treatment group (Figure 1). Fifteen patients withdrew during the 4-month course of the trial, and 2 patients were withdrawn from the trial for commencing a variety of relevant medications during the treatment period. Patient data on study entry are shown in Table 3. Patient groups were similar in terms of age, weight, and sex distributions. There were no significant differences among patients in the 3 groups in terms of total severity of symptoms as judged independently by both the patient and gastroenterologist, or in duration of the disease as reported by patients. Patients allocated to the placebo group had a higher mean score for constipation, while patients allocated to the standard treatment had a higher mean score for diarrhea. Compliance with study medication was high as measured by a questionnaire item and by random pill counts and did not differ between groups (95% for standard CHM, 94% for individualized CHM, and 95% for placebo). Fiber and nonstudy medication consumption did not change significantly for any group during the treatment period.The reliability of the BSS (ie, consistency of the measure) was determined by a test-retest assessment during the run-in period prior to treatment commencing (week 0-2). Correlation between the BSS completed during the initial interview with the gastroenterologist and then 2 weeks later at the clinical treatment centers was high for total score (r=0.7; P<.01, 2-tailed) and for each individual symptom (bloating [r=0.8], pain [r=0.6], diarrhea [r=0.8], and constipation [r=0.7]).The credibility scale also was examined for test-retest reliability. Correlation between the first and second administration of this scale was significant (r=0.6; P <.01, 2-tailed). The correlation coefficients for each of the 4 scale items were in the range of 0.47 to 0.65. The internal consistency of the credibility scale based on interitem correlations on both occasions were uniformly high and Cronbach coefficient α (representing average interitem correlations) was .87 and .86 for the first and second occasions, respectively.The visual analog scales within the BSS had high face validity (100-mm lines with severity marked at the extreme right and absence of symptom marked at the extreme left) and have high content validity (ie, they incorporate the key domains of interest—pain and discomfort, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea). Testing items in the scale for concurrent validity at the commencement and end of treatment showed that the gastroenterologist's assessment of the patient correlated highly with the patient's own perception of severity of symptoms. For both, Pearson correlation coefficient was in the range of r=0.63 to 0.84 for any 1 item (symptom) or for the total symptom score (P<.01 on all occasions).Assessment of the credibility scale for construct validity through a principal components factor analysis based on the first administration revealed only 1 factor with an eigenvalue greater than 1 (2.89). This factor accounted for 72.2% of variance in this data set. All items had a high correlation with this first factor, suggesting satisfactory construct validity.For all 5 main outcome measures—total mean BSS scores and global improvement as assessed by patients and gastroenterologists, and interference with life as assessed by patients—patients receiving the standard CHM formulation responded significantly better than patients in receiving placebo. Patients receiving individualized CHM treatment also responded significantly better on 4 of 5 scores than patients receiving placebo. Overall, patients receiving individualized CHM fared slightly worse than those receiving standard CHM treatment.At the end of treatment, there was a significant difference between the mean total BSS scores as assessed by patients, with patients in the standard CHM group and those in the individualized CHM group responding significantly better compared with placebo (Table 3). No significant differences were noted between standard and individualized CHM treatment groups.The BSS scores completed by the gastroenterologist at the end of treatment showed a significant difference between the mean total BSS scores for patients in each group, with patients receiving standard and individualized CHM responding significantly better compared with those taking placebo (P = .001). A post hoc Bonferroni test demonstrated that this difference was significant for patients in the standard group (P=.001) but not for those in the individualized group (P=.08).Patients receiving standard herbal formulations improved by 44% (according to patients) and 59% (according to gastroenterologists), in contrast to patients in the placebo group who improved 22% (according to patients) and 19% (according to gastroenterologists). Patients receiving individualized CHM improved by 42% (according to patients) and 40% (according to gastroenterologists).There was a significant association between the treatment groups and the change in the degree to which IBS symptoms caused interference with life and activities by the end of treatment (P=.03). Of patients receiving the standard formulation and of those receiving individual formulations, 63% and 54%, respectively, stated that treatment resulted in IBS causing less interference in their lives and activities, compared with 37% of patients in the placebo group.At the end of the trial, the ratings of both gastroenterologists and patients who believed that the IBS symptoms had improved, stayed the same, or worsened (Table 4) showed a significant association by treatment group (P=.007). Of patients receiving standard CHM and of those receiving individual CHM, 76% and 64%, respectively, stated they had improved during treatment. In contrast, only 33% of patients receiving placebo stated they had improved during treatment.The gastroenterologists' responses also demonstrated a significant association between the treatment group and how patients felt at the end of treatment ( χ24=17.1; P =.002). Seventy-eight percent of patients receiving the standard CHM formulation, 50% of those receiving individual CHM, and 30% of those receiving placebo were judged by the gastroenterologist as having improved during treatment. There was significant correlation between patients' and gastroenterologists' assessment of global improvement and of total BSS scores at the beginning and end of the trial (all r>0.5, all significant to P≤.01 level, 2-tailed).Two patients withdrew from the trial because of discomfort associated with the treatment. One patient developed upper gastrointestinal discomfort while taking the standard CHM formulation. A second patient developed headaches (although a history of headaches existed), which gradually subsided on discontinuation of therapy. Recommencement of treatment caused gastrointestinal discomfort, and the patient was subsequently withdrawn from the study. No other major adverse effects were noted. Liver function tests obtained after 8 weeks of treatment showed no abnormal values.Results of the BSS administered to patients 14 weeks after completion of the course of treatment (but before treatment codes were revealed) demonstrated that the treatment effect weakened, with only the individualized CHM group maintaining improvement (P<.10) (Table 3). However, there was significant association between the treatment group and how patients felt at the 14-week follow-up (P=.02). Of patients who had received the standard CHM formulation and of those who had received individual CHM formulations, 63% and 75%, respectively, stated that they still felt an improvement compared with 32% of patients who received placebo.The success of blinding patients to treatment was tested at the beginning, end, and on 2 other occasions during the course of treatment. At 2 weeks into treatment, the overall mean on this 6-point scale was 4, indicating that patients on average viewed CHM as only moderately credible and were not a self-selected group with a bias in favor of complementary medicine. No significant difference was noted between groups at outset and at end of treatment. However, the mean credibility score decreased slightly with time for the placebo group and remained strong within the standard CHM group. Since the standard CHM treatment proved the most effective, the increased difference in credibility toward the end of the treatment may be a reflection that this group of patients was receiving the most benefit. There was a significant negative correlation between the final mean credibility score and the final patient-rated BSS score (r=−0.43; P<.01) and the final gastroenterologist-rated BSS score (r=−0.58; P <.01).To our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial in CHM that fully adheres to the traditional Chinese diagnostic and treatment processes while using a strict and accepted methodological protocol. Our study demonstrated that CHM is effective in the management of symptoms related to IBS with, in some cases, effects lasting up to 14 weeks after completion of treatment. Patients receiving standard or individualized CHM treatment demonstrated significantly better outcomes (both clinically and statistically) than patients receiving the placebo on all 5 key outcome measures. However, patients receiving individualized CHM formulations had less improvement during treatment than patients receiving the standard formula, although this difference was not statistically significant.The first null hypothesis that CHM treatment of IBS with a standard herbal formula is of no value is rejected. The second null hypothesis that individualized treatment of IBS according to the principles of traditional CHM is of no added value to treatment with a standard formula is partially accepted. While there were no significant differences between patients receiving standard or individualized treatment at the end of the treatment period, on follow-up, patients in the individualized treatment group had maintained more substantial improvement.Three Chinese herbalists with contrasting Chinese medicine education backgrounds participated in this trial. In theory, their degree of education in Chinese herbalism should affect their ability to successfully tailor treatment for patients. While outcome differences between practitioners were observable for this cohort of patients, sample sizes were too small to make reliable conclusions. Furthermore, the overall differences between standard and individualized CHM may be relatively small (as both are active treatments) and require larger sample sizes. This does not, however, account for the notable improvement that was maintained in the individualized CHM group after cessation of treatment.One plausible explanation may be that the standard CHM formulation was suitably designed to treat the complex presentations of IBS but was incapable of successfully dealing with underlying causes for most patients as viewed by Chinese medicine. The tailored formulations may have permitted the herbalists to individually address these underlying causes and deficiencies. Moreover, there may be active ingredients in the CHM formulation with properties similar to antispasmodic or anxiolytic drugs. Chinese herbal formulas are complex and viewed as a number of active ingredients working together, rather than 1 specific active substance. The standard formulation used in this study is not a sedative or anxiolytic preparation in traditional CHM terms but is a formulation considered to regulate and strengthen bowel function.In our study, all efforts were made for the approach in the 3 treatment groups to be indistinguishable. The credibility scale was demonstrated to be a reliable and valid instrument and presents strong evidence that blinding was maintained throughout the trial. The slight decrease in credibility score seen in the placebo group toward the end of the trial was accounted for by its significant correlation with the actual treatment outcome. The authors are convinced that patients, herbalists, and gastroenterologists were all successfully blinded.There were minimal adverse effects reported during the study. Liver function screening was included as a precaution because liver dysfunction associated with the use of Chinese herbs has been noted in other studies.8,22 Liver dysfunction was not expected with the type and form of herbs used in this study. In our study, liver function was reassessed after 8 weeks of treatment. We have no data on liver function after that time, and therefore cannot comment on longer-term safety of these CHM products. Raw herbs used as starting products are partly regulated in Australia.We conclude that Chinese herbal formulations may offer symptom improvement to some patients with IBS. In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial CHM was shown to be effective in the management of IBS. Patients receiving the standard CHM formulation fared best during the course of treatment, while patients receiving the individualized treatments found that the benefit gained lasted beyond the treatment period. Although not all patients responded to this therapy, our findings support the consideration of further investigation of Chinese herbal medicine as a treatment option for IBS.","year":"1998","createdAt":"2020-10-26T00:07:50.278Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-26T00:07:50.278Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f96135625109f1b986f0bea","title":"Herbs as Medicines","link":"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/210301?resultClick=1","abstract":"Herbs and related products are commonly used by patients who also seek conventional health care. All physicians, regardless of specialty or interest, care for patients who use products that are neither prescribed nor recommended. Some herbs have been extensively studied, but little is known about others. When a patient asks for advice regarding the use of a particular herb, how should a physician respond? Similarly, how does a physician determine if a patient's symptoms are caused by a \"remedy\"? This review attempts to answer these questions by investigating pertinent definitions, the history of herbs in medicine, epidemiology and prevalence of herbal use, and relevant psychosocial issues.While a complete review of specific herbs is impossible in this setting (>20,000 herbal and related products are used in the United States),1 the potential benefits and hazards of some of the more popular herbal products in use are examined (Table 1).The earliest evidence of humans' use of plants for healing dates back to the Neanderthal period.3 In the 16th century, botanical gardens were created to grow medicinal plants for medical schools.4 Herbal medicine practice flourished until the 17th century when more \"scientific\" pharmacological remedies were favored.5In the United States, the history of herbal use begins in the early colonial days when health care was provided by women in the home. Initially, they used homemade botanical remedies and later purchased similar products as \"patent medicines.\" In the early 19th century, scientific methods became more advanced and preferred, and the practice of botanical healing was dismissed as quackery. In the 1960s, with concerns over the iatrogenic effects of conventional medicine and desire for more self-reliance, interest in \"natural health\" and the use of herbal products increased.5 Recognition of the rising use of herbal medicines and other nontraditional remedies led to the establishment of the Office of Alternative Medicine by the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, Md) in 1992. Worldwide, herbal use again became popular; in 1974 the World Health Organization (Geneva, Switzerland) encouraged developing countries to use traditional plant medicines to \"fulfill a need unmet by modern systems.\"5Thirty percent of all modern drugs are derived from plants.3 Some of the more familiar ones are listed in Table 2.4,6,7Estimates of the prevalence of herbal medicine use differ, with studies concluding that between 3% and 93% of the US population uses herbs (Table 3).7-10 The variability of these estimates is due to discrepant definitions of herbs (Table 1) as well as different inclusions of the length of use (ie, ever vs in the last 12 months).Internationally, the use of botanical medicines is generally higher. For example, 70% of \"Western\" doctors in Japan prescribe kampo drugs daily.11 Eighty percent of the world's population relies primarily on traditional medicines for their health care needs.5,12 It is certain that physicians are seeing patients who are using herbs, and, as is discussed, this use can affect the patient's health problems and effects of conventional treatments.The amount of money spent on herbal remedies is significant. Americans spent $553 million in 8000 health food stores in 1994,13 and from all sources, the estimate of US \"medical\" herb sales is $1.2 billion in 1996.14 Sales of herbal medicines are growing by 20% a year, and herbs are the largest growth area in retail pharmacy, far exceeding growth in the conventional drug category.15Costs to the individual and costs of individual products can also be substantial, albeit variable. An epidemiological study10 of patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus found that the average herbal user was spending $18 per month on herbs (range, $0-$175). Individual products have variable costs, dependent on both the product and its source (homegrown, imported, from a health food store, or from an herbalist). In another study16 of herb use among patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), one product recommended by a health food store sold for almost $150 for a month's supply.Insurance plans and managed care organizations are beginning to offer reimbursement for alternative treatments. In fact, coverage of chiropractic treatment is mandated by law in at least 45 states, acupuncture in 7 states, and naturopathy in 2 states.17 Insurance plans that cover alternative health care often require physician referral for these services, highlighting the importance of physician awareness. One managed care company, Oxford Health Plans, Norwalk, Conn, is planning to cover alternative treatments, including some that use herbal remedies, basing their decision on a survey showing that 33% of its 1.5 million members had sought alternative treatment in the last 2 years. American Western Life Insurance Company, San Mateo, Calif, has a \"prevention plus\" plan that covers herbal medicines. Industry analysts expect many other insurance plans to follow suit to compete for this untapped multibillion dollar market.17 Although reimbursement for herbal medicines is in its infancy, it is expected to grow tremendously along with the continued boom in sales of herbal products and alternative health care in general. In Germany, herbs prescribed by physicians are covered by insurance, whereas over-the-counter herbs are not; and German physicians are much more knowledgeable about their use.14 Physicians must become familiar with herbal medicine, as more insurance companies will expect their physicians to make referrals or suggest herbal products.There are multiple reasons patients turn to herbal therapies. Often cited is a \"sense of control, a mental comfort from taking action,\"9 which helps explain why many people taking herbs have diseases that are chronic or incurable, such as diabetes, cancer, arthritis, or AIDS. In such situations, they often believe that conventional medicine has failed them. When patients use home remedies for acute, often self-limited conditions, such as a cold, sore throat, or bee sting, it is often because professional care is not immediately available, too inconvenient, costly, or time consuming.9,18In rural areas, there are additional cultural factors that encourage the use of botanicals, such as the concept of an interplay between the environment and culture, a \"man-earth\" relationship.12 Religious beliefs, which can be traced to the medieval doctrine of signatures, are also prominent: \"The good Lord has put these yerbs here for man to make hisself with. They is a yerb, could we but find it, to cure every illness [sic].\"19 People believe that where an area gives rise to a particular disease, it will also support plants that can be used to cure it.5Natural plant products are perceived to be healthier than manufactured medicines.12 Additionally, reports of adverse effects of conventional medications are found in the lay press at a much higher rate than reports of herbal toxicities, in part because mechanisms to track adverse effects exist for conventional medicines whereas such data for self-treatment is harder to ascertain. Even physicians often dismiss herbs as harmless placebos,10 and many consumers and physicians alike mistakenly believe that anything in a pill form has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1In 1993, the FDA began scrutinizing the herbal and supplement industry, which triggered a massive letter-writing campaign organized by health food stores that encouraged consumers to \"write your congressman or kiss your supplements goodbye.\" Under pressure, the FDA compromised its plans, creating the supplement category, which includes vitamins, minerals, and herbs and created the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act (DSHEA) signed October 1994. The DSHEA requires no proof of efficacy, no proof of safety, and sets no standards for quality control for products labeled as supplements. Although the DSHEA requires that supplements not promise a specific cure on the label, they may claim effect. Now, if questions arise, the burden lies with the FDA to prove a product unsafe, rather than a company proving its product safe. Manufacturers must put a message on the label stating that claims have not been reviewed by the FDA, but this statement can be subtle.1 In contrast, regulating agencies in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada enforce standards of herb quality and safety assessment on manufacturers.20,21Because of the lack of requirements for quality control, safety, and efficacy, consumers cannot determine if an herb's active ingredients are actually in the product, if the ingredient is bioavailable, if the dosage is appropriate, if the next bottle they buy will have the same components, or what else is in the pill besides the claimed ingredients.1Any particular herb or mixture can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and from batch to batch; an herb that is not toxic or therapeutic in one form or strength may be helpful or harmful in a different preparation.Potency of various compounds is affected by growing conditions, storage, handling, and preparation such that potency of various products from the same plant can vary 10,000-fold.1 Manufacturers use varying methods for processing the same herbs; for example, the plant can be ground up and put into pill form, or pharmaceutical methods can be used to extract the desired compound, assay the composition, and make tablets of consistent strength.1Consumer Reports1 looked at the composition of 10 different ginseng products on the market in 1995. The amount of ginseng per tablet was listed on the labels, but the amount of ginsenosides, thought to be the active components, was not listed. They found striking differences between the products (Figure 1), which could have an impact if a patient changed from one brand to another, especially as ginseng does have dose-dependent adverse effects.Labels may be incorrect, accidentally or intentionally. The same common name may be applied to different plants recommended for different illnesses.22 Some products labeled as ginseng actually also contain mandrake (scopolamine) or snakeroot (reserpine) because of the high cost of pure ginseng.23 Additives may be used, yet not listed on labels; they may be the source of the therapeutic effect. Examples include steroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, prescription antibiotics, sedatives, and narcotics.1,24-26Herbs can be misidentified or the wrong part of the plant may be picked. Such an error was the cause of an outbreak of belladonna poisoning attributable to an herbal tea in New York City,1 and a similar misidentification led to digitalis poisoning from a mislabeled plantain extract.27Heavy metals are often found in herbal preparations from other countries as they are thought to help cure without being absorbable. However, there are multiple reports in the literature of poisoning with lead, arsenic, cadmium, copper, and mercury found in herbal preparations from foreign countries.28-34 Also problematic with herbs imported from foreign sources is that written instructions, if any, are often in foreign languages.32Controlled studies of herbal medicines are not profitable. There is little motivation for manufacturers to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trials to prove efficacy because (1) they are not required to do so and (2) they cannot patent the product to recoup the estimated $350 million it costs to prove a new drug effective and safe.13 An entirely new drug must be created, or a novel extraction procedure or pharmaceutical dosage form must be discovered as a result of undertaking the study to produce patentable and thus profitable studies.Despite these limitations, some scientific studies are being performed. Such studies often originate in other countries where the funding constraints are not as problematic, and where regulatory authorities require some basic assessment of safety and efficacy.With the resultant lack of solid scientific analysis in the United States, claims for benefits are thus mainly supported solely with anecdotal case reports that fail to consider the natural history of the disease or the placebo effect. Toxic effects, if any, are seldom reported.It is important to acknowledge that all conventional drugs have potential toxicities. However, in contrast to herbal products, conventional drugs undergo trials and postapproval surveillance that define these toxicities, giving practitioners data on that to weigh risks and benefits of treatment. The therapeutic window and dosage are also defined, as are the constituents of the medicine. Because of rigorous quality control, each pill has the same ingredients as another. Adverse reactions to herbal medicines are probably underrecognized and underreported.35Physicians should become familiar with some of the more common herbal toxicities to determine if an herb is causing a patient's problems; the easiest way is to keep a shelf reference in the office.21,36,37 Additionally, one can seek case reports in the literature, send the remedy in question to a laboratory (at university hospital settings, call the toxicology laboratory) that can analyze a particular herb for its constituents and possible contaminants, or consult Poisindex (a list of plants considered unsafe by the FDA is available). The FDA also posts recent warnings on herbal products on their Internet page (http://www.fda.gov). With mild toxicities, such as gastrointestinal upset or mildly elevated values on liver function tests, the physician can try stopping the herbal treatment and see if the problem resolves and consider a rechallenge for recurrence.Table 4 outlines toxicities of some of the more popular herbs, listed by organ system.There has been little evaluation of interactions between regulated drugs and herbs, but knowledge of some adverse reactions (and therapeutic actions) of herbal medicines can help one predict drug interactions. For example, herbs containing cardiac glycosides may potentiate effects of digoxin; herbs with diuretic effects may potentiate digoxin toxicity via potassium loss. Herbs that can cause hypertension or hypotension can interfere with prescription antihypertensive agents; hypoglycemic herbs can interfere with glycemic control in a patient with diabetes. Some herbs interfere with prescription medications by altering their metabolism. For example, Eucalyptus can induce microsomal liver enzymes51 while flavonoids from Echinacea purpurea are known to inhibit the cytochrome P-4503A4 and sulfotransferase drug-metabolizing enzymes.52,53Not only might herbal therapy be toxic, but using an herbal remedy over a proven conventional therapy can be dangerous, too. Many oncologists have seen patients with early-stage cancers who eschewed curative conventional care in favor of herbal medicines. After these herbal treatments failed, the patients returned to the oncologists with incurable metastatic diseases. In fact, studies54 have shown that patients who use herbs and other alternative therapies are more likely to abandon potentially beneficial conventional therapy when faced with an illness. Patients may also continue detrimental behaviors, such as smoking tobacco or drinking large amounts of alcohol, with the rationalization that the herbal remedy they are taking will be protective.An herb that may be safe in small doses may become dangerous in higher doses. The risk of overdose is higher in herbal preparations than conventional medicines because of the already mentioned product variability. Consider the patient who assumed if \"some is good, more is better\" with respect to a copper-containing supplement he was taking. As he began to feel worse, he increased the dose. By the time he came to the attention of conventional health providers, he was unable to eat and was wasted and jaundiced, and had acquired Wilson disease.13 Patients may assume herbs such as garlic and nutmeg to be safe, as they are commonly used in cooking without adverse effect. However, herbs in extract form are often much more potent than the traditionally used form, and can be harmful (Table 3).Of the 20,000 available products, which is the physician most likely to encounter? A 1995 survey of 163 US health food retail stores revealed that the top 10 selling herbs were echinacea (Echinacea purpurea and angustifolia), garlic (Allium sativum), goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), ginseng (Asian Panax ginseng and American Panax quinquefolius), ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba), saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), aloe (Aloe species), ma huang (Ephedra sinica), Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus), and cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon).55 More recent trends suggest that St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), valerian (Valeriana officinalis), and feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) will likely earn a top 10 designation when 1998 data become available.Patients decide which herbs to use in a variety of ways. Because of the requirements that herbal medicines must not directly claim cures on the label, manufacturers have become creative with marketing. Products are given names that allude to their effects, such as \"Insomnia,\" \"PMS,\" \"Sleep,\" and \"Get Trim.\" Pamphlets, books, and other advocacy literature not subject to labeling guidelines are shelved near herbs. Patients also get information through word of mouth, encouraged by anecdotal reports from friends. An herbalist who has training in the use of plants for healing may be consulted.Advice can be found from health food store workers. An undercover 1993 FDA study asked clerks what to buy \"for my immune system,\" \"high blood pressure,\" or \"something that works on cancer.\" From 129 clerks surveyed, 120 specific and highly variable recommendations were received.1 Phillips et al,16 in 1995, surveyed 20 Birmingham, Ala, area health food stores for their recommendations for AIDS. Combination products (with names like \"Immunace,\" \"Immunaction,\" or \"Immunectar\") were most frequently recommended; ginseng-containing products were recommended second (and were the most expensive). Pharmacists, on the other hand, are unlikely to give specific recommendations on herbal products sold in their stores, and say they do not know much about them.1 In fact, only 5% of the US herbal market is actually sold in pharmacies.20People can also explore the Internet to discover information about herbs. Internet sources are often perceived as \"published\" and therefore entirely factual. However, most sites merely list herbs and their uses, few mention regulations, safety, or efficacy. Even an herb with well-recognized toxicities, such as ephedra, may have no cautionary statement. A few sample Web sites are listed below:When patients or practitioners want nonbiased information on a commonly used herb, they are advised to buy a book that bases advice on published and critically reviewed literature. A comprehensive literature search will ensure the most scientific, peer-reviewed information is being reviewed, but this process is often time consuming and, thus, impractical. Beginning in 1978, the German equivalent of the FDA went as far as to publish a series of herb recommendations, the Commission E Monographs, which detail dosages and indications for herbs whose efficacy is supported by the literature, and these have recently become available in the United States. However, the extrapolation of these European findings (usually conducted with well-characterized, pharmaceutical herbal preparations) to herbs available in the United States is complicated by the relative lack of regulatory standards in this country, as described earlier.The great variation in US herb quality is unfortunate in light of the known pharmacological actions in humans of well-characterized botanical preparations. If one can put the question of US regulation aside, comments can thus be made on the efficacy of some of the best-selling herbs mentioned above.Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) ranks as one of the most well characterized of the widely used herbs. Listed in The National Formulary until 1950, valerian has been described in human studies as possessing sedative and anxiolytic activity56 and is often combined with other sedative herbs like hops (Humulus lupulus).In the case of Ginkgo biloba, which contains ginkgolides that antagonize platelet-activating factor, human studies were greatly facilitated by the availability of a high-quality extract (EGb 761) from the manufacturer, Willmar Schwabe, in Karlsrube, Germany. The efficacy of Ginkgo biloba extract in improving or delaying cognitive deficits was recently demonstrated in a multicenter US trial of 309 patients with early-stage Alzheimer dementia. Improvements in 2 of 3 clinical parameters of cognitive function were observed as early as at 12 weeks of Ginkgo extract, Egb 761, when compared with placebo.57 Understandably, Ginkgo should be used with care in this population due to the prevalence of prescription anticoagulant therapy.Ginseng is another widely used herb touted in Chinese traditional medicine as an \"adaptogen\" that allows the body to respond to physical and emotional stress. The best data to date support a role for ginseng as a vasodilator and in serving a cardioprotective role in the presence of oxygen free radicals.58 The mechanism of these effects is likely due to certain ginsenosides present in Panax ginseng that appear to stimulate nitric oxide synthase and increase nitric oxide production and release.For the practicing internist, the most interesting data come from efficacy comparisons between herbs and prescription medications. For example, limited data suggest that saw palmetto compares favorably with finasteride in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.59 In treating mood disorders, St John's wort has been shown to be equally efficacious to the older, tricyclic antidepressants.60 However, it should be stressed that these studies were performed with highly characterized botanical preparations under the guidance of trained physicians. The wisdom of herbal self-treatment, as is often the case in the United States, is discussed in the following section, along with more information about specific herbs the internist is likely to encounter.Given the previously detailed shortcomings of herbal preparations in the United States, the question arises whether any herbs possess pharmacological activity distinct from prescription or over-the-counter drugs that might therefore warrant their cautious use. Such herbs are few. The most commonly used herb in the United States and Europe, Echinacea purpurea, may be one. Unlike over-the-counter decongestants or antihistamines, alkylamide and polysaccharide constituents of echinacea possess significant in vitro and in vivo immunostimulation due to enhanced phagocytosis and nonspecific T-cell stimulation.61 However, to our knowledge, only a few clinical trials have been done with echinacea, and only a handful were well designed. One well-designed, double-blind study randomized 100 patients with acute flulike illness to an echinacea extract or placebo and showed that echinacea decreased the duration of symptoms from 10 to 7 days. Another study, with 647 students from the University of Cologne given echinacea or placebo prophylactically during flu season, showed a 15% reduction in the number of colds in the group given echinecea. Neither study used commonly available preparations of echinacea.37Most herbs fall into the category of agents that share pharmacological mechanisms of action with already existing prescription or over-the-counter drugs. Based on a logical consideration of the current state of herb standardization and pharmacokinetic evaluation, the patient would be best steered toward a regulated pharmaceutical preparation capable of a predictable pharmacological response. For example, powdered ginger root has been tested in humans for prophylaxis against motion sickness compared with dimenhydrate (Dramamine).62 While one study63 reported 1.8 mg of ginger superior to 100 mg of dimenhydrate, a follow-up study failed to show any efficacy of ginger. Other examples of herbs possessing actions similar to existing, regulated drugs are feverfew for migraines,64 valerian for anxiety,65 and garlic for hypercholesterolemia.66Of greater concern to the physician is when patients use herbs with redundant pharmacological activity for diseases not recommended for self-treatment. Miller67 heightened the public's awareness of the antidepressant actions of St John's wort, an herb containing the potential monoamine oxidase inhibitor hypericin. While St John's wort has shown promising antidepressant action,60 it is unlikely that patients can make a diagnosis of endogenous depression, much less differentiate their condition from medical conditions mimicking depression. In addition, there remains concern for hypertensive reactions resulting from concomitant ingestion of high tyramine-containing foods and St John's wort, and hypericin is well known to cause photosensitivity.68 With St John's wort, the question is not whether the herb has therapeutic efficacy but rather issues of safety and appropriateness of the disease as a candidate for self-treatment.Similarly, the use of saw palmetto for benign prostatic hypertrophy presents another dilemma. While hydrophobic extracts of Serenoa repens berries indeed possess 5α-reductase inhibitory and androgen receptor antagonistic activities in vitro,69 it is unwise for men to self-diagnose benign prostatic hypertrophy, with the clear risk of potentiating the growth of undiagnosed prostatic carcinoma.Herbal remedies are commonly used by patients who access conventional health care. Few have been shown to have beneficial effects beyond those of conventionally regulated products, and they may be costly, adulterated with dangerous additives, inherently toxic, or cause the patient to forgo potentially curative care.All medicines can be toxic under specific circumstances; there is always a risk that an adverse reaction will present a hazard to a patient. With licensed medicines, however, regulations ensure the risk is small and monitor the medicine's efficacy, safety, and quality. No such controls over herbal medicines exist.36 As stated by Brown and Marcy,9 the hazards of self-treatment are no less serious because of the presence of similar hazards in conventional medicine.If a patient presents with a problem that might be due to an herb, the physician should discontinue the product and watch for resolution. Reference books, Poisindex, or MEDLINE should be consulted to see if such an adverse reaction has been described. The FDA has implemented MEDWATCH, a toll-free number to which adverse effects of herbs can be reported (1-800-332-1088).70 If necessary, herbs can be sent to laboratories for content analysis, either to a toxicology laboratory or a pharmacology department. Botany departments at major universities can also be a source of information.If patients ask if \"herbal medicines\" in general are safe or effective, they should be counseled about the lack of regulations for quality, safety, or efficacy, the differences in preparations from different manufacturers, and the lack of mechanism for reporting adverse effects. Curious patients can be directed to read the books mentioned, and cautioned against biased information that they may receive from health food store employees, pamphlets shelved near herbs, and the Internet.If patients mention a friend who was helped by a certain remedy or an advertisement that was seen depicting a dramatic success with a certain herb, they should be counseled on the dangers of anecdotal reports. Patients take our recommendations of conventional medicines because we suggest it, not because we present them with reams of data from randomized controlled trials; thus, it is not unexpected that their approach to the use of unconventional medicine is the same.Patients with chronic conditions such as AIDS or cancer should also be warned that some of the adverse effects of herbals are often similar to symptoms of problems associated with their disease or treatment, thus making it difficult to discern if the disease or the \"remedy\" is the problem.Classically trained physicians cannot ignore herbal medicines anymore. We must realize that patients are using herbal medicines, and insurance companies are beginning to cover the costs and are even asking us to oversee the use of herbs in certain situations. We must all become educated about these products, and at the very least know where to find information when we need it.Asking patients about supplement use during the initial history is thus imperative. Patient disclosure of herb use may provide an opportunity for the physician to redirect the patient toward effective conventional health care. By taking a complete drug and supplement history, a dialogue can be initiated to rationally compare the appropriateness of herbal remedies and regulated pharmaceuticals in relation to the severity of the condition. Until herbs in this country are more strictly regulated, however, no classically trained physician should recommend an herbal product to a patient. For the herb-using patient who views conventional medicine with ambivalence, the physician can foster a more open and communicative relationship by demonstrating an objective understanding of both alternative and conventional approaches.Accepted for publication November 20, 1997.Reprints: Lisa Corbin Winslow, MD, HealthONE Center for Health Sciences Education, 1719 E 19th Ave, 5C-East, Denver, CO 80218.","year":"1998","createdAt":"2020-10-26T00:07:50.279Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-26T00:07:50.279Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f96135b25109f1b986f0beb","title":"Herbal Medicine for the Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease: Clinical Considerations","link":"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/210378?resultClick=1","abstract":"Herbs have been used as medical treatments since the beginning of civilization and some derivatives (eg, aspirin, reserpine, and digitalis) have become mainstays of human pharmacotherapy. For cardiovascular diseases, herbal treatments have been used in patients with congestive heart failure, systolic hypertension, angina pectoris, atherosclerosis, cerebral insufficiency, venous insufficiency, and arrhythmia. However, many herbal remedies used today have not undergone careful scientific assessment, and some have the potential to cause serious toxic effects and major drug-to-drug interactions. With the high prevalence of herbal use in the United States today, clinicians must inquire about such health practices for cardiac disease and be informed about the potential for benefit and harm. Continuing research is necessary to elucidate the pharmacological activities of the many herbal remedies now being used to treat cardiovascular diseases.Since the beginning of human civilization, herbs have been an integral part of society, valued for both their culinary and medicinal properties. Herbal medicine has made many contributions to commercial drug preparations manufactured today including ephedrine from Ephedra sinica (ma-huang), digitoxin from Digitalis purpurea (foxglove), salicin (the source of aspirin) from Salix alba (willow bark), and reserpine from Rauwolfia serpentina (snakeroot), to name just a few. A naturally occurring β-adrenergic blocking agent with partial agonism has been identified in an herbal remedy.1 The recent discovery of the antineoplastic drug paclitaxel from Taxus brevifolia (pacific yew tree) stresses the role of plants as a continuing resource for modern medicine.However, with the development of patent medicines in the early part of the 20th century, herbal medicine has been losing ground to new synthetic medicines touted by scientists and physicians to be more effective and reliable. Nevertheless, about 3% of English-speaking adults in the United States still report having used herbal remedies in the preceding year.2 This figure is probably much higher for non–English-speaking Americans. Despite this heavy use of herbal medicines in the United States, health practitioners often fail to ask about their use when taking clinical histories. It is imperative that physicians become more aware of the wide array of herbal medicines available, as well as learning more about their beneficial and adverse effects.3Part of the problem for both consumers and physicians has been the paucity of scientific data on herbal medicines used in the United States.4 As a result, those who wish to obtain factual information regarding the therapeutic use or potential harm of herbal remedies would have to obtain it from books and pamphlets, most of which base their information on traditional reputation rather than relying on existing scientific research. One may wonder why the herbal industry never chose to simply prove its products safe and effective. The answer is primarily economical. With the slim chance of patent protection for the many herbs that have been in use for centuries, pharmaceutical companies have not provided financial support for research on the merits of herbal medicine.5 At the same time, the National Institutes of Health have only been able to offer limited funding for this purpose.This review examines herbal medicines that affect the cardiovascular system both in terms of efficacy and safety as gleaned from the scientific literature that is available. These herbs are categorized under the primary diseases they treat. However, most herbal medicines have multiple cardiovascular effects that frequently overlap. The purpose of this organization is to simplify, not to pigeonhole herbs under specific diseases. In general, the dilution of active components in herbal medicines results in fewer adverse and toxic effects in comparison with the concentration of active components in the allopathic medicines. However, these adverse effects and drug interactions should not be overlooked; cardiovascular disease is a serious health hazard and no herbal remedy regimen should be initiated without careful consideration of its potential impact (Table 1).A number of herbs contain potent cardioactive glycosides, which have positive inotropic actions on the heart. The drugs digitoxin, derived from either D purpurea (foxglove) or Digitalis lanata, and digoxin, derived from D lanata alone, have been used in the treatment of congestive heart failure for many decades. Cardiac glycosides have a low therapeutic index, and the dose must be adjusted to the needs of each patient. The only way to control dosage is to use standardized powdered digitalis, digitoxin, or digoxin. When 12 different strains of D lanata plants were cultured and examined, their total cardenolide yield ranged from 30 to almost 1000 nmol/1 g.6 As is evident, treating congestive heart failure with nonstandardized herbal drugs would be dangerous and foolhardy.Some common plant sources of cardiac glycosides include D purpurea (foxglove, already mentioned), Adonis microcarpa and Adonis vernalis (adonis), Apocynum cannabinum (black Indian hemp), Asclepiascurassavica (redheaded cotton bush), Asclepias friticosa (balloon cotton), Calotropis precera (king's crown), Carissa spectabilis (wintersweet), Cerebra manghas (sea mango), Cheiranthus cheiri (wallflower), Convallaria majalis (lily of the valley, convallaria), Cryptostegia grandiflora (rubber vine), Helleborus niger (black hellebore), Helleborus viridus, Nerium oleander (oleander), Plumeria rubra (frangipani), Selenicerus grandiflorus (cactus grandiflorus), Strophanthus hispidus and Strophanthus kombe (strophanus), Thevetia peruviana (yellow oleander), and Urginea maritima (squill).5,7-15 Even the venom glands of the animal Bufo marinus (cane toad) contain cardiac glycosides.8 Recently, the digitalislike steroid in the venom of the B marinus toad was identified as a previously described steroid, marinobufagenin. Marinobufagenin demonstrated high digoxinlike immunoreactivity and was antagonized with an antidigoxin antibody.16Accidental poisonings and even suicide attempts with ingestion of cardiac glycosides are abundant in the medical literature.17-21 Some herbal remedies (eg, Siberian ginseng) can elevate synthetic digoxin drug levels and cause toxic effects.22 In the United States, there are about 15,000 intoxications due to accidental or intentional ingestion of poisonous plants annually.23 In 1993, 2388 toxic exposures in the United States were reported to be due to plant glycosides. Of these, the largest percentage were attributed to oleander (ie, 25%).24 In the case of oleander, all plant tissues, including the seeds, roots, stems, leaves, berries, and blossoms, are considered extremely toxic.19 In fact, death in humans has been reported following ingestion of as little as 1 oleander leaf.25 The clinical manifestations of oleander intoxication, as well as other natural glycosides, is virtually identical to digoxin overdose. Morbidity and mortality are mainly related to cardiotoxic adverse effects that usually include life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, bradycardia, and heart block. The diagnosis should rely on the clinical presentation of unexplained hyperkalemia, and cardiac, neurologic, and gastrointestinal symptoms.19The diagnosis can be further supported by the detection of the substance digoxin in a radioimmunoassay for digoxin. However, the extent of cross-reactivity between the cardiac glycosides from herbal sources and antibodies used in the radioimmunoassays has not been clearly defined.26 For this reason, digoxin assays may serve to confirm the suspected diagnosis but not to quantify the severity. Once the diagnosis has been established, the use of digoxin-specific Fab antibody fragments may be helpful in the treatment of severe intoxication. Other modalities, such as dialysis, cannot be easily facilitated because, like digoxin, natural glycosides are distributed extensively into peripheral tissues.The root of R serpentina (snakeroot), the natural source of the alkaloid reserpine, has been a Hindu Ayurvedic remedy since ancient times. In 1931, Indian literature first described the use of R serpentina root for the treatment of hypertension and psychoses; however, the use of Rauwolfia alkaloids in Western medicine did not begin until the mid1940s.27 Both standardized whole root preparations of R serpentina and its reserpine alkaloid are officially monographed in the United States Pharmacopeia.28 A powdered whole root of 200 to 300 mg orally is equivalent to 0.5 mg of reserpine.29Reserpine was one of the first drugs used on a large scale to treat systemic hypertension. It acts by irreversibly blocking the uptake of biogenic amines (norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin) in the storage vesicles of central and peripheral adrenergic neurons, thus leaving the catecholamines to be destroyed by the intraneuronal monoamine oxidase in the cytoplasm. The depletion of catecholamines accounts for reserpine's sympatholytic and antihypertensive actions. Reserpine's effects are long lasting, since recovery of sympathetic function requires synthesis of new storage vesicles, which takes days to weeks. Reserpine lowers blood pressure by decreasing cardiac output, peripheral vascular resistance, heart rate, and renin secretion. With the introduction of other antihypertensive drugs with fewer central nervous system adverse effects, the use of reserpine has diminished. The daily oral dose of reserpine should be 0.25 mg or less, and as little as 0.05 mg if given with a diuretic. Using the whole root, the usual adult dose is 50 to 200 mg/d administered once daily or in 2 divided doses.27-29Rauwolfia alkaloids are contraindicated for use in patients with previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to these substances, in patients with a history of mental depression (especially with suicidal tendencies), in patients with active peptic ulcer disease or ulcerative colitis, and in patients receiving electroconvulsive therapy. The most common adverse effects are sedation and inability to concentrate and perform complex tasks. Reserpine may cause mental depression, sometimes resulting in suicide, and its use must be discontinued at the first sign of depression. Reserpine's sympatholytic effect and its enhancement of parasympathetic actions account for its well-described adverse effects: nasal congestion, increased gastric secretion, and mild diarrhea.27-30Stephania tetrandra is an herb sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat hypertension. Tetrandrine, an alkaloid extract of S tetrandra, has been shown to be a calcium ion channel antagonist, paralleling the effects of verapamil. Tetrandrine blocks T and L calcium channels, interferes with the binding of diltiazem and methoxyverapamil at calcium-channel binding sites, and suppresses aldosterone production.31,32 A parenteral dose (15 mg/kg) of tetrandrine in conscious rats decreases mean, systolic, and diastolic blood pressures for more than 30 minutes; however, an intravenous 40-mg/kg dose killed the rats by myocardial depression. In stroke-prone hypertensive rats, an oral dose of 25 or 50 mg/kg produced a gradual and sustained hypotensive effect after 48 hours without affecting plasma renin activity.33 In addition to its cardiovascular actions, tetrandrine has reported antineoplastic, immunosuppressive, and mutagenic effects.31Tetrandrine is 90% protein-bound with an elimination half-life of 88 minutes, according to dog studies; however, rat studies have shown a sustained hypotensive effect for more than 48 hours after a 25- or 50-mg oral dose. Tetrandrine causes liver necrosis in dogs orally administered 40 mg/kg of tetrandrine 3 times weekly for 2 months, reversible swelling of liver cells with a 20-mg/kg dose, and no observable changes with a 10-mg/kg dose.31 Given the evidence of hepatotoxicity, many more studies are necessary to establish a safe dosage of tetrandrine in humans.More recently, tetrandrine has been implicated in an outbreak of rapidly progressive renal failure, termed Chinese herb nephropathy. Numerous individuals developed the condition after using a combination of several Chinese herbs as part of a dieting regimen. It has been hypothesized that the cause may be attributed to misidentification of S tetrandra; nonetheless, questions still remain as to the role of tetrandra in the development of this serious toxic effect.34-37The root of Lingusticum wallichii is used in traditional Chinese medicine as a circulatory stimulant, hypotensive drug, and sedative.38 Tetramethylpyrazine, the active constituent extracted from L wallichii, inhibits platelet aggregation in vitro and lowers blood pressure by vasodilation in dogs. With its actions independent of the endothelium, tetramethylpyrazine's vasodilatory effect is mediated by calcium channel antagonism and nonselective antagonism of α-adrenergic receptors. Some evidence suggests that tetramethylpyrazine acts on the pulmonary vasculature.31 Currently, there is insufficient information to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this herbal medicinal.Uncaria rhynchophylla is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat hypertension. Its indole alkaloids, rhynchophylline and hirsutine, are thought to be the active principles of U rhynchophylla's vasodilatory effect. The mechanism of U rhynchophylla's actions is unclear. Some studies point to an alteration in calcium ion flux in response to activation, whereas others point to hirsutine's inhibition of nicotine-induced dopamine release.31 One in vitro study has shown U rhynchophylla extract relaxes norepinephrine-precontracted rat aorta through endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms. For the endothelium-dependent component, U rhynchophylla extract appears to stimulate endothelium-derived relaxing factor and/or nitric oxide release without involving muscarinic receptors.39 Also, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that rhynchophylline can inhibit platelet aggregation and reduce platelet thromboses induced with collagen or adenosine diphosphate plus epinephrine.31 Safety and efficacy cannot be evaluated at this time because of a lack of clinical data.Veratrum (hellebore) is a perennial herb grown in many parts of the world. Varieties include Veratrumviride from Canada and the eastern United States, Veratrumcalifornicum from the western United States, Veratrumalbum from Alaska and Europe, and Veratrum japonicum from Asia. All Veratrum plants contain poisonous alkaloids known to cause vomiting, bradycardia, and hypotension. Most cases of Veratrum poisonings are due to misidentification with other plants. Although once a treatment for hypertension, the use of Veratrum alkaloids has lost favor owing to a low therapeutic index and unacceptable toxicity, as well as the introduction of safer antihypertensive drug alternatives.40Veratrum alkaloids enhance nerve and muscle excitability by increasing sodium ion conductivity. They act on the posterior wall of the left ventricle and the coronary sinus baroreceptors, causing reflex hypotension and bradycardia via the vagus nerve (Bezold-Jarisch reflex). Nausea and vomiting are secondary to the alkaloids' actions on the nodose ganglion.40The diagnosis of Veratrum toxicity is established by history, identification of the plant, and strong clinical suspicion. Clinical symptoms usually occur quickly, often within 30 minutes.41 Treatment is mainly supportive and directed at controlling bradycardia and hypotension. Veratrum-induced bradycardia usually responds to treatment with atropine; however, the blood pressure response to atropine is more variable and requires the addition of pressors. Other electrocardiographic changes, such as atrioventricular dissociation, may also be reversible with atropine.42 Seizures are a rare complication and may be treated with conventional anticonvulsants. For patients with preexisting cardiac disease, the use of β-agonists or pacing may be necessary. Nausea may be controlled with phenothiazine antiemetics. Recovery usually occurs within 24 to 48 hours.40Evodia rutaecarpa (wu-chu-yu) is a Chinese herbal drug that has been used as a treatment for hypertension. It contains an active vasorelaxant component called rutaecarpine that can cause endothelium-dependent vasodilation in experimental models.43Crataegus hawthorn, a name encompassing many Crataegus species (such as Crataegus oxyacantha and Crataegus monogyna in the West and Crataegus pinnatifida in China) has acquired the reputation in modern herbal literature as an important tonic for the cardiovascular system that is particularly useful for angina. Crataegus leaves, flowers, and fruits contain a number of biologically active substances, such as oligomeric procyanins, flavonoids, and catechins. From current studies, Crataegus extract appears to have antioxidant properties and can inhibit the formation of thromboxane as well.44,45Also, Crataegus extract antagonizes the increases in cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid levels in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein in rats fed a hyperlipidemic diet; thus, it may inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis.46 This hypocholesterolemic action may be due to an up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors resulting in greater influx of plasma cholesterol into the liver. Crataegus also prevents cholesterol accumulation in the liver by enhancing cholesterol degradation to bile acids, as well as suppressing cholesterol biosynthesis.47According to another study, Crataegus extract, in high concentrations, has a cardioprotective effect on ischemic-reperfused hearts without causing an increase in coronary blood flow.48 On the other hand, oral and parenteral administration of oligomeric procyanins of Crataegus has been shown to lead to an increase in coronary blood flow in both cats and dogs.49,50 Double-blind clinical trials have demonstrated simultaneous cardiotropic and vasodilatory actions of Crataegus.51 In essence, Crataegus increases coronary perfusion, has a mild hypotensive effect, antagonizes atherogenesis, and has positive inotropic and negative chronotropic actions.46,52 In a recent multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, an extract of Crataegus was shown to clearly improve the cardiac performance of patients with New York Heart Association class II heart failure. In this study, the primary parameter analyzed was the heart rate product (systolic blood pressure × heart rate).53 Recent studies have suggested that the mechanism of cardiac action for Crataegus species may be due to the inhibition of the 3‘, 5‘-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase.54Hawthorn is relatively devoid of adverse effects. In fact, in comparison with other inotropic drugs such as epinephrine, amrinone, milrinone, and digoxin, Crataegus has a potentially reduced arrhythmogenic risk because of its ability to prolong the effective refractory period, while the other drugs mentioned previously all shorten this parameter.55,56 Also, it should be noted that concomitant use of hawthorn with digitalis can markedly enhance the activity of digitalis.5,57 Undoubtedly, more studies are needed to show that hawthorn can be used safely and effectively.Because of its resemblance to Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng), Panax notoginseng has acquired the common name of pseudoginseng, especially since it is often an adulterant of P ginseng preparations. In traditional Chinese medicine, the root of P notoginseng is used for analgesia and hemostasis. It is also often used in the treatment of patients with angina and coronary artery disease.38Panax notoginseng has been described as a calcium ion channel antagonist in vascular tissue. More specifically, its pharmacological action may be as a novel and selective calcium ion antagonist that does not interact with the L-type calcium ion channel but rather may interact with the receptor-operated calcium ion channel.58Although clinical trials are lacking, in vitro studies using P notoginseng suggest possible cardiovascular effects. One study that used purified notoginsenoside R1, extracted from P notoginseng, on human left umbilical vein endothelial cells showed a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of tissue-type plasminogen activating factor without affecting the synthesis of plasminogen activating inhibitor. Thus, fibrinolytic parameters were enhanced.59 Another study suggests that P notoginseng saponins may inhibit atherogenesis by interfering with the proliferation of smooth muscle cells.60 In vitro and in vivo studies using rats and rabbits demonstrate that P notoginseng may be useful as an antianginal drug, since it dilates coronary arteries in all concentrations. The role of P notoginseng in the treatment of hypertension is less certain, since P notoginseng causes vasodilation or vasoconstriction depending on the concentration and target vessel.61 The results of these in vitro and in vivo studies are encouraging; however, clinical trials will be necessary to make a more informed decision regarding the use of P notoginseng.Salvia miltiorrhiza (dan-shen), a relative of the Western sage Salvia officinalis, is native to China. In traditional Chinese medicine, the root of S miltiorrhiza is used as a circulatory stimulant, sedative, and cooling drug.38Salvia miltiorrhiza may be useful as an antianginal drug because it has been shown to dilate coronary arteries in all concentrations, similar to P notoginseng. Also, S miltiorrhiza has variable action on other vessels depending on its concentration, so it may not be as helpful in treating hypertension.61 In vitro, S miltiorrhiza, in a dose-dependent fashion, inhibits platelet aggregation and serotonin release induced by either adenosine diphosphate or epinephrine, which is thought to be mediated by an increase in platelet cyclic adenosine monophosphate caused by S miltiorrhiza's inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase.62Salvia miltiorrhiza appears to have a protective action on ischemic myocardium, enhancing the recovery of contractile force on reoxygenation.63 More recently, S miltiorrhiza has been shown to protect myocardial mitochondrial membranes from ischemia-reperfusion injury and lipid peroxidation because of its free radical–scavenging effects.64 Qualitatively and quantitatively, a decoction of S miltiorrhiza was as efficacious as the more expensive isolated tanshinones.59Clinical trials will be necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of S miltiorrhiza. Of note, it has been observed clinically that when S miltiorrhiza and warfarin sodium are coadministered, there is an increased incidence in warfarin-related adverse effects; in rats S miltiorrhiza was shown to increase the plasma concentrations of warfarin as well as the prothrombin time.65In addition to its use in the culinary arts, garlic (Allium sativum) has been valued for centuries for its medicinal properties. Garlic is one of the herbal medicines that has been examined more closely by the scientific community. In recent decades, research has focused on garlic's use in preventing atherosclerosis. Garlic, like many of the other herbal medicines discussed previously, has demonstrated multiple beneficial cardiovascular effects. A number of studies have demonstrated these effects that include lowering blood pressure, inhibiting platelet aggregation, enhancing fibrinolytic activity, reducing serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and protecting the elastic properties of the aorta.Consumption of large quantities of fresh garlic (0.25 to 1.0 g/kg or about 5-20 average sized 4-g cloves in a person weighing 78.7 kg) has been shown to produce the beneficial effects mentioned earlier.66 In support of this, a recent double-blind cross-over study was conducted on moderately hypercholesterolemic men that compared the effects of 7.2 g of aged garlic extract with placebo on blood lipid levels. This study found that there was a maximal reduction of 6.1% in total serum cholesterol levels and 4.6% in LDL cholesterol levels with garlic compared with placebo.67However, despite positive evidence from numerous trials, some investigators have been hesitant to outright endorse the routine use of garlic for cardiovascular disease because many of the published studies had methodological shortcomings,66,68-72 perhaps because constituent trials were small, lacking statistical power. Also, inappropriate methods of randomization, lack of dietary run-in period, short duration, or failure to undertake intention-to-treat analysis may explain the cautious acceptance of previous meta-analyses.73 In fact, one recent study found no demonstrable effect of garlic ingestion on lipid and lipoprotein levels. This study used a cross-over design protected by a washout period to reduce between-subject variability as well as close assessment and reporting of dietary behavior, which had been lacking in previous trials.74 Another study found no effect of garlic on cholesterol absorption, cholesterol synthesis, or cholesterol metabolism.71 As is evident, the precise extent of garlic's impact on atherosclerosis remains controversial; larger, more rigorously designed trials may be necessary to better determine its utility in preventing cardiovascular disease.Garlic has also been studied in hypertensive patients as a blood pressure–lowering agent. Similar to its lipid effects, no conclusive studies have been conducted and many methodological shortcomings exist in study designs. The results of one meta-analysis that considered 8 different trials suggest some clinical use for patients with mild hypertension, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use as routine clinical therapy.68 Garlic has also been shown to possess antiplatelet activity. In the past, this action was mostly documented in vitro.75 A new study examined the effect of the consumption of a fresh clove of garlic on platelet thromboxane production and showed that after 26 weeks, serum thromboxane levels were reduced about 80%.76 This may prove to be beneficial in the prevention of thrombosis in the future. Recently, the effect of long-term garlic intake on the elastic properties of the aorta was also studied. Participants in the trial (limited to those aged 50-80 years) consumed 300 mg/d of standardized garlic powder for more than 2 years. The results showed that the pulse-wave velocity and standardized elastic vascular resistance of the aorta were lower in the garlic group than in the control group. Consequently, long-term garlic powder intake may have a protective effect on the elastic properties of the aorta related to aging.77 In these ways, garlic has shown numerous beneficial cardiovascular effects that need to be investigated further to determine its therapeutic utility.Intact cells of garlic bulbs include an odorless, sulfur-containing amino acid known as allinin. When garlic is crushed, allinin comes into contact with allinase, which converts allinin to allicin. Allicin has potent antibacterial properties, but it is also highly odoriferous and unstable. Ajoenes, self-condensation products of allicin, appear to be responsible for garlic's antithrombotic activity. Most authorities now agree that allicin and its derivatives are the active constituents of garlic's physiological activity. Fresh garlic releases allicin in the mouth during the chewing process. Dried garlic preparations lack allicin but contain allinin and allinase. Since allinase is inactivated in the stomach, dried garlic preparations should be coated with enteric so that they pass through the stomach into the small intestine where allinin can be enzymatically converted to allicin. Few commercial garlic preparations are standardized for their allicin yield based on allinin content, hence making their effectiveness less certain.5 However, one double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 261 patients for 4 months using one 800-mg tablet of garlic powder daily, standardized to 1.3% allinin content, demonstrated significant reductions in total cholesterol (12%) and triglyceride levels (17%).78Aside from a garlic odor on the breath and body, moderate garlic consumption causes few adverse effects. However, consumption in excess of 5 cloves daily may result in heartburn, flatulence, and other gastrointestinal disturbances. Some people have reported allergic reactions to garlic, most commonly allergic contact dermatitis. Patch testing with 1% diallyl disulfide is recommended when garlic allergy is suspected.79 Because of its antithrombotic activity, garlic should be used with caution in people taking oral anticoagulants concomitantly.5,80The resin of Commiphora mukul (gugulipid), a small, thorny tree native to India, has long been used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat lipid disorders. The primary mechanism of action of gugulipid is through an increase in the uptake and metabolism of LDL cholesterol by the liver.81 In a double-blind, cross-over study completed in 125 patients taking gugulipid compared with 108 patients taking clofibrate, the average decrease in serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels was 11% and 16.8%, respectively, with gugulipid compared with 10% and 21.6%, respectively, with clofibrate. In general, hypercholesterolemic patients responded more favorably to gugulipid therapy than hypertriglyceridemic patients.82 Moreover, it was shown in another randomized, double-blind trial that C mukul also decreased LDL cholesterol levels by 12.5% and the total cholesterol–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio by 11.1%, whereas the levels were unchanged in the placebo group.83Besides being potentially as effective in lowering blood lipid levels as modern hyperlipidemic drugs, gugulipid may even be safer. In the trial mentioned previously, compliance was greater than 96%, with only the adverse effects of headache, mild nausea, and hiccups noted.83 However, it has been shown that gugulipid may affect the bioavailability of other cardiovascular drugs, namely, propranolol hydrochloride and diltiazem hydrochloride. Gugulipid significantly reduced the peak plasma concentration and area under the curve of both these drugs, which may lead to diminished efficacy or nonresponsiveness.84 Undoubtedly, gugulipid is a natural lipid-lowering drug with potential for therapeutic use, but rigorous, larger clinical trials will be necessary to further evaluate its safety and efficacy before it can be endorsed as an alternative therapy for hyperlipidemia and prevention of atherosclerosis.Maharishi amrit kalash-4 and Maharishi amrit kalash-5 are 2 complex herbal mixtures with significant antioxidant properties that have been shown to inhibit LDL oxidation in patients with hyperlipidemia. In experimental studies, the herbal mixtures have also been shown to inhibit enzymatic- and nonenzymatic-induced microsomal lipid peroxidation and platelet aggregation.85Having existed for more than 200 million years, Ginkgo biloba (maidenhair tree) was apparently saved from extinction by human intervention, surviving in Far Eastern temple gardens while disappearing for centuries in the West. It was reintroduced to Europe in 1730 and became a favorite ornamental tree.38,86 Although the root and kernels of G biloba have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine, the tree gained attention in the West during the 20th century for its medicinal value after a concentrated extract of G biloba leaves was developed in the 1960s. At least 2 groups of substances within G biloba extract (GBE) demonstrate beneficial pharmacological actions. The flavonoids reduce capillary permeability as well as fragility and serve as free radical scavengers. The terpenes (ie, ginkgolides) inhibit platelet-activating factor, decrease vascular resistance, and improve circulatory flow without appreciably affecting blood pressure.57,87 Continuing research appears to support the primary use of GBE for treating cerebral insufficiency and its secondary effects on vertigo, tinnitus, memory, and mood; also, GBE appears to be useful for treating peripheral vascular disease, including diabetic retinopathy and intermittent claudication.5,57,87-91In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, EGb 761, which is a standardized extract of G biloba with respect to its flavonol glycoside and terpene lactone content, was shown to significantly decrease the areas of ischemia as measured by transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen during exercise. Because of its rapid anti-ischemic action, EGb 761 may be valuable in the treatment of intermittent claudication and peripheral artery disease in general.92Also, studies have been examining the cardioprotective efficacy of EGb 761 in regard to its anti–free radical action in myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury. In vitro studies with animal models have shown that this compound may exert such an effect.93,94 A clinical study of 15 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery demonstrated that oral EGb 761 therapy may limit free radical–induced oxidative stress occurring in the systemic circulation and at the level of the myocardium during these operations.95 It remains to be studied whether extracts of G biloba may be used as pharmacological adjuvants to limit tissue damage and metabolic alterations following coronary bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarctions, or even in managing coronary thrombosis.Although approved as a drug in Europe, Ginkgo is not approved in the United States and is instead marketed as a food supplement, usually supplied as 40-mg tablets of extract. Since most of the investigations examining the efficacy of GBEs used preparations such as EGb 761 or LI 1370, the bioequivalence of other GBE products has not been established. The recommended dosage in Europe is one 40-mg tablet taken 3 times daily with meals (120 mg/d).5,87 Adverse effects due to GBE are rare but can include gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, and allergic skin rash.5,87Known mostly as a culinary spice and flavoring agent, Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) is listed in many herbal sources as a tonic and all-around stimulant. Traditionally, rosemary leaves are said to enhance circulation, aid digestion, elevate mood, and boost energy. When applied externally, the volatile oils are supposedly useful for arthritic conditions and baldness.5Although research on rosemary is scant, some studies have focused on antioxidant effects of diterpenoids, especially carnosic acid and carnosol, isolated from rosemary leaves. In addition to having antineoplastic effects, antioxidants in rosemary have been credited with stabilizing erythrocyte membranes and inhibiting superoxide generation and lipid peroxidation.96,97 Essential oils of rosemary have demonstrated antimicrobial, hyperglycemic, and insulin-inhibiting properties.98,99 Rosemary leaves contain high amounts of salicylates, and its flavonoid pigment diosmin is reported to decrease capillary permeability and fragility.57,100,101Despite the conclusions derived from in vitro and animal studies, the therapeutic use of rosemary for cardiovascular disorders remains questionable, because few, if any, clinical trials have been conducted using rosemary. Because of the lack of studies, no conclusions can be reached regarding the use of the antioxidants of rosemary in inhibiting atherosclerosis. Although external application may cause cutaneous vasodilation from the counterirritant properties of rosemary's essential oils, there is no evidence to support any prolonged improvement in peripheral circulation.5 While rosemary does have some carminative properties, it may also cause gastrointestinal and kidney disturbances in large doses.5,101 Until more studies are done, rosemary should probably be limited to its use as a culinary spice and flavoring agent rather than as a medicine.The seeds of horse chestnut, Aesculus hippocastanum, have long been used in Europe to treat venous disorders such as varicose veins. The saponin glycoside aescin from horse chestnut extract (HCE) inhibits the activity of lysosomal enzymes thought to contribute to varicose veins by weakening vessel walls and increasing permeability, which result in dilated veins and edema.5 In fact, recent research has shown that A hippocastanum inhibits only against hyaluronidase but not elastase, and this activity is linked mainly to the saponin escin.102 In animal studies, HCE, in a dose-dependent fashion, increases venous tone, venous flow, and lymphatic flow. It also antagonizes capillary hyperpermeability induced by histamine, serotonin, or chloroform. This extract has been shown to decrease edema formation of lymphatic and inflammatory origin. Horse chestnut extract has antiexudative properties, suppressing experimentally induced pleurisy and peritonitis by inhibiting plasma extravasation and leukocyte emigration, and its dose-dependent antioxidant properties can inhibit in vitro lipid peroxidation.103,104 Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with HCE show are eduction in edema, measured using plethysmography.105,106In another recent randomized, placebo-controlled study, the efficacy and safety of class 2 compression stockings and dried HCE were compared. Both HCE and the compression stockings decreased lower leg edema after 12 weeks of therapy; the results showed an average 43.8-mL reduction with HCE and 46.7-mL with compression stockings, while the placebo group showed an increase of 9.8 mL. Both HCE and compression therapy were well tolerated, with no serious adverse effects. This study may indicate that both of these modalities are reasonable alternatives for the effective treatment of patients with chronic venous insufficiency.107 Also, HCE has been shown to markedly improve other symptoms associated with chronic venous insufficiency, such as pain, tiredness, itching, and tension in the swollen leg, in a case-observation study.108 Aside from effects on venous insufficiency, prophylactic use of HCE has been thought to decrease the incidence of thromboembolic complications of gynecological surgery. However, since this issue is still controversial,109 this does not appear to be the case.109Standardized HCE is prepared as an aqueous alcohol extract of 16% to 21% of triterpene glycosides, calculated as aescin. The usual initial dosage is 90 to 150 mg/d of aescin, which may be reduced to 35 to 70 mg/d if clinical benefit is seen.5 Standardized HCE preparations are not available in the United States, but nonstandardized products may be available.Some manufacturers promote the use of topical preparations of HCE for treatment of varicose veins as well as hemorrhoids; however, at least one study has demonstrated poor aescin distribution at sites other than the skin and muscle tissues underlying the application site.110 Moreover, the involvement of arterioles and veins in the pathophysiology of hemorrhoids makes the effectiveness of HCE doubtful, since HCE has no known effects on the arterial circulation. For now, research studies have yet to confirm any clinical effectiveness of topical HCE preparations.Although adverse effects are uncommon, HCE may cause gastrointestinal irritation. Parenteral aescin has produced isolated cases of anaphylactic reactions, as well as hepatic and renal toxic effects.5,111-113 In the event of toxicity, aescin can be eliminated via dialysis, with elimination dependent on protein-binding.114 Horse chestnut extract is also one of the components of venocuran, a drug marketed as a treatment for venous disorders. In 1975, venocuran was determined to cause a pseudolupus syndrome characterized by recurrent fever, myalgia, arthralgia, pleuritis, pulmonary infiltrates, pericarditis, myocarditis, and mitochondrial antibodies in the absence of nuclear antibodies after prolonged treatment.115,116 Venocuran has since been withdrawn from the market; however, the nature of its pathophysiologic action is still unknown.Like A hippocastanum, Ruscus aculeatus (butcher's broom) is also known for its use in treating venous insufficiency. Ruscus aculeatus is a short evergreen shrub found commonly in the Mediterranean region. Two steroidal saponins, ruscogenin and neurogenin, extracted from the rhizomes of R aculeatus are thought to be its active components.101 In vivo studies on hamster cheek pouch reveal that topical Ruscus extract dose dependently antagonizes histamine-induced increases in vascular permeability.117 Moreover, topical Ruscus extract causes dose-dependent constriction of venules without appreciably affecting arterioles.118 Topical Ruscus extract's vascular effects are also temperature dependent and appear to counter the sympathetic nervous system's temperature-sensitive vascular regulation: venules dilate at a lower temperature (25°C), constrict at near physiologic temperatures (36.5°C), and further constrict at higher temperatures (40°C); arterioles dilate at 25°C, are unaffected at 36.5°C, and remain unaffected or constrict at 40°C, depending on Ruscus concentration.119 Based on the influence of prazosin, diltiazem, and rauwolscine, the peripheral vascular effects of Ruscus extract appear to be selectively mediated by effects on calcium channels and α1-adrenergic receptors with less activity at α2-adrenergic receptors.117,118 Also, R aculeatus exhibits strong antielastase activity and has little effect on hyaluronidase in direct contrast to A hippocastanum. This activity may contribute to their efficacy in the treatment of venous insufficiency since these enzyme systems are involved in the turnover of the main components of the perivascular amorphous substance.102Several small clinical trials using topical Ruscus extract support its role in treating venous insufficiency. One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 18 volunteers showed a beneficial decrease in femoral vein diameter (median decrease, 1.25 mm) using duplex B-scan ultrasonography. The decrease was measured 2.5 hours after applying 4 to 6 g of a cream containing 64 to 96 mg of Ruscus extract.120 In another small trial (N = 18) it was shown that topical Ruscus extract may be helpful in reducing venous dilation during pregnancy.121 Oral agents may be useful as topical drugs for venous insufficiency, although the evidence is less convincing.122Although capsule, tablet, ointment, and suppository (for hemorrhoids) preparations of Ruscus extract are available in Europe, only capsules are available in the United States. These capsules contain 75 mg of Ruscus extract and 2 mg of rosemary oil.101 Aside from occasional nausea and gastritis, adverse effects from using R aculeatus have rarely been reported, even in high doses.57 Nevertheless, one should be wary of any drug that has not been thoroughly tested. Although there is ample evidence to support the pharmacological activity of R aculeatus, there is still a relative deficiency of clinical data to establish its actual safety and efficacy. Until more studies are completed, no recommendations regarding dosage can be offered.In traditional Chinese medicine, arrhythmias are categorized by the characteristic symptoms of palpitations and abnormal pulse. Numerous Chinese herbal medicines are identified to have antiarrhythmic effects, such as xin bao, ci zhu wan, bu xin dan, and several others.123 However, few clinical trials have been conducted to study their effects and safety. Xin bao is one agent that has begun to be examined. The mechanism of action of xin bao is thought to be through its stimulation and increased excitability of the sinuatrial node.124 In one observational study, the effects of xin bao were documented in 87 patients with sick sinus syndrome. Xin bao was administered orally 2 to 3 times per day for 2 months. Patients with major symptoms of sick sinus syndrome, which included dizziness, palpitations, and chest pressure, improved significantly after treatment.124 No serious adverse effects were noted. This study suggests a possible role of xin bao in the treatment of sick sinus syndrome. However, more scientific research on xin bao and other antiarrhythmic Chinese herbs mentioned previously are necessary before any recommendations can be made for their routine use in patients with sick sinus syndrome or other arrhythmias.With the high prevalence of herbal medicine use in the United States, health practitioners should remember to inquire about such health practices when taking clinical histories and remain informed of the beneficial or harmful effects of these treatments. Continuing research is necessary to elucidate the pharmacological activities of the many cardiopotent herbal medicines and to stimulate future pharmaceutical development of therapeutically beneficial herbal drugs. However, such research is currently lacking in the United States and requires more support from government agencies before the full potential of these types of treatments can be determined. At the same time, legal surveillance of herbal medicine use with low safety margins should be instituted for the sake of public health; this is especially imperative for those herbs with adverse cardiovascular reactions125 and drug interactions. As more information becomes available regarding the safety and efficacy of herbal medicines through new clinical trials, research-supported claims may one day become available to consumers and physicians in a manner similar to the allopathic medicines.Accepted for publication July 23, 1998.Reprints: William H.

Due to multiple uses, species is being over exploited in its natural habitats at the Garhwal Himalaya. The propagation by rhizome has emerged as an effective method of multiplication and conservation of plant species. In the present study, an attempt was made to evaluate the impact of different hormones, i.e., Indole -3 butyric acid (IBA) and Indole-3 acetic acid (IAA) for the root induction in G. kurroo. For this, the growing tip of rhizome was split into 2, 3 and 4 longitudinal parts. Each split contained ½, ⅓ or ¼ of longitudinal section of mother rhizome and above ground part with growing buds. Two piece rhizome exhibited significantly higher survival percentage (97.5%) under control conditions followed by three piece (90%) and four pieces (22.5%) cuttings. Two and three pieces IBA-treated cuttings showed better results than IAA treatments and enhanced the emergence percentage. Therefore, macroproliferation of G. kurroo rhizome is an easy and effective technique for multiplication and conservation of this endangered herb.

The present study has been designed to investigate the anticonvulsant potential of chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of leaves of AM against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and maximal electroshock (MES) induced convulsions. All the three extracts were administered (i.e. 100, 200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) for 7 days and at the end of the treatment convulsions were induced experimentally. Diazepam and phenytoin (1 mg/kg, i.p. and 25 mg/kg, i.p., respectively) were used as reference anticonvulsant drugs against experimentally induced convulsions. High doses (400 mg/kg, p.o.) of chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts both significantly decreased the extent of MES- and PTZ-induced convulsions. On the other hand, ethyl acetate extract at lowest and medium selected doses (i.e. 100 mg/kg, p.o. and 200 mg/kg, p.o., respectively, for 7 days) had also significantly attenuated PTZ-induced convulsions. However, methanol extract at any of the doses used (i.e. 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) did not show any significant effect on PTZ- and MES-induced convulsions.

The objective of the present study is to investigate the morphological and phytochemical variabilities in the wild taxa of D. metel. On the basis of 17 phenotypic traits three morphotypes I, II and III were identified, and highly significant variations were seen among them. The three morphotypes of the species, with quite distinct flower colours, that is, purple, yellow and white, had the same diploid chromosome number n=12. The pharmacological activities of D. metel are mainly attributed to the presence of two tropane alkaloids, namely hyoscyamine and scopolamine. For the systematic quantification of hyoscyamine and scopolamine in different plant parts such as, leaves, roots and seeds of these three wild morphotypes (I, II and III) of D. metel, the high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) technique was employed. Better resolution was achieved by using chloroform:acetone:diethyl amine (50: 40: 10 v/v/v) as a mobile phase. Quantitative, densitometric evaluation of the plate was performed in the absorbance/reflectance mode at 530 nm. The average recovery of hyoscyamine and scopolamine was 97.4 and 96.8%, respectively, showing the excellent reproducibility of the method. The calibration curves were linear in the range of 1000–4000 ng for hyoscyamine and 500-2000 ng for scopolamine, respectively. The method was simple, precise, specific, sensitive, accurate and could be used for routine analysis as well as quality control of raw materials and herbal formulations.

As a result, proper authentication of the drug for safe administration as an herbal medicine assumes paramount significance. Aim: Prsniparni, Uraria picta (Jacq.) DC., is one such drug for which three different botanical entities are commonly used as substitutes, namely U. lagopodoides (L.)DC; Desmodium gangeticum (L.) DC., and Pseudarthria viscida (L.) Wight and Arn.; all belonging to the family Fabaceae. The anatomical, histochemical and powder microscopic characters of the four species were compared in the field‑collected samples to validate the quality herbal drug and to find the similarity and dissimilarity of the substitute species. Materials and Methods: Histological and histochemical characters were studied using sectioned materials following standard protocols. Histochemical methods were adopted to localize the presence of the primary metabolites such as starch, lipids, total proteins and amino acids and the secondary metabolites such as volatile oils, resins, tannins, lignin and pectin. Results: The present study shows that the authentic species U. picta and substitute species U. lagopodoides showing higher similarities of 90% based on histology, histochemistry and powder microscopy analysis. Other two candidates, D. gangeticum and P. viscida showing 60 % and 55% similarities, respectively, when compared to U. picta.

Microglias are the resident innate immune cells in the central nervous system and produce a barrage of factors (ILs, TNF α, NO, PGs, SOD) that are toxic to neurons. Evidence supports that the unregulated activation of microglia, in response to environmental toxins, endogenous proteins and neuronal death, results in the production of toxic factors that propagate neuronal injury. Herbal medicine has long been used to treat neural symptoms. Although the precise mechanisms of action of herbal drugs have yet to be determined, some of them have been shown to exert anti‑inflammatory and / or antioxidant effects in a variety of peripheral systems. Now, as increasing evidence indicates that neuroglia‑derived chronic inflammatory responses play a pathological role in the central nervous system, anti‑inflammatory herbal medicine and its constituents are being proved to be potent neuroprotectors against various brain pathologies. Structural diversity of medicinal herbs makes them a valuable source of novel lead compounds against therapeutic targets that are newly discovered by genomics, proteomics and high‑throughput screening. In the following review, we discuss the common thread of microglial activation across numerous neurodegenerative diseases, define current perceptions of how microglia are damaging neurons and explain how the microglial response to neuronal damage results in a self‑propelling cycle of neuron death.

(Amalaki), Commiphora wightii (Arn.), Bhand (Commiphora mukul) (Guggulu), and one herbo-mineral drug Black Bitumen, or Mineral Pitch (Shilajit) for explanations of thrust and theme of the title. Our methodology to get data is just by referring relevant literature from the ancient Samhita (Charaka Samhita onward) period to contemporary peer-reviewed published papers in journals of repute. Experimental and clinical studies and practices of Amalaki, Guggulu, and Shilajit validated classical claims of the therapeutic effect of these drugs. There is the probability that ancient Ayurvedic pharmacology is at par to express genuineness of herbal medicines.","year":"2015-12-14","createdAt":"2020-10-04T12:56:49.819Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T12:56:49.819Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f79c6917689dceac610329e","title":"Hepatoprotective activity studies of herbal formulations","link":"http://greenpharmacy.info/index.php/ijgp/article/view/20","abstract":"Traditional system of medicine recommends various hepatoprotective agents and preparations to treat hepatic disorders.

But, the advent of drug resistance in human pathogenic bacteria and others has prompted a search for more and better antibiotics. This has led to the identification of a new promising source of antimicrobials known as endophytes. Hence, our study was aimed to investigate the ability of endophytic fungi isolated from T. brownii to produce secondary metabolites, which can act as antimicrobial agents. In this preliminary investigation, the leaves were used for isolation of endophytic fungi and fermented, and the cell free ferment broth was subjected to antimicrobial screening against six human pathogens; Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans by using standard protocol of agar well diffusion method. The results of the endophyte isolation gave three fungal isolates named TBF1, TBF2 and TBF3. According to morphological and microscopical characterizations, the isolates were found to be similar to Rhizophus oryzae (TBF1), Aspergillus niger (TBF2) and Aspergillus flavus (TBF3). Two of the three isolated endophytes i.e., TBF2 and TBF3 showed potential antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and no inhibition was found against other tested pathogens. The present study has proven that T. brownii may be a rich source of endophytic fungi with antimicrobial potential and our findings may form a basis for further studies on endophytic fungi from medicinal plants for antimicrobial activities.

However, despite its use in traditional medicine, to date, there appears to have been no chemical or biological studies published on this plant. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the leaf latex of A. sinana for its antibacterial and antifungal activities, and to isolate and characterise the compounds that are responsible for the antimicrobial effect of the latex. Materials and Methods: The latex was extracted with methanol. Isolation of compounds was achieved by repeated preparative TLC, and spectroscopic techniques including 1H, 13C‑NMR and MS were used for characterisation of the isolated compounds. Antimicrobial activity tests were performed against 21 bacterial and 4 fungal pathogens using the disc diffusion method. Results and Conclusion: Three compounds isolated from the leaf latex were identified as the anthrones, aloin, aloinoside and microdontin. Among the isolated compounds, aloinoside and microdontin were found to possess comparable activity (MIC 5 μg/ml) with that of ciprofloxacin against several Gram‑negative bacterial strains and Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, microdontin showed potent and comparable activity with the standard antifungal drug griseofulvin against Penicillum spp. These findings support the traditional uses of the plant for the treatment of various infections and wound.

Roots of Argyreia speciosa are used in several Ayurvedic preparations as brain tonic and nervine tonic. The present work was undertaken to justify the traditional claim of the plant as nootropic and antiamnesic agent in mice. The ethyl acetate and ethanolic fractions (EtAS) of roots were selected for the study. Exteroceptive behavioural models such as elevated plus maze and Water maze were used to assess the short-term memory, whereas, scopolamine and natural ageing- induced amnesia served as interoceptive models. The whole brain acetyl cholinesterase activity was measured to assess the effect of A. speciosa on the central cholinergic system. Scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) increased the transfer latency significantly (P,0.01) in young mice on the first and second day as compared to control indicating the impairment of memory. Pretreatment with EAAS (100 and 200 mg/ kg, p.o.) significantly (P,0.01) attenuated scopolamine and ageing-induced amnesia. Escape latency time was recorded in the water maze model as an index of acquisition, and trials were conducted for 4 days. The mean time spent in target quadrant (TSTQ) during retrieval trial on fifth day was taken as the index of retrieval (memory). EAAS (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) administered before the training trial (from day 1 to day 4), significantly (P,0.01) attenuated scopolamine and ageing-induced decrease in TSTQ during the retrieval test on the fifth day. EAAS (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly produced reduction in whole brain acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) activity of both young and aged mice thus exhibiting anti-AChE activity in whole brain homogenate compared to Piracetam, scopolamine and control groups of mice.

The extract (1, 10, 50 g/l), oxytocin (4×10−5 to 8×10−3 g/l), acetylcholine (4×10−6 to 8×10−4 g/l), atropine (4×10−3 g/l), phenoxybenzamine (4×10−3 g/l), diphenhydramine(2×10−1 g/l), and verapamil (12×10−2 g/l) were used. Log concentration response curves were plotted and EC50 and Emax were obtained. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnet corrections using Graph pad Instat version 2.05a was used for statistical analysis. The extract produced dose-dependent contraction of the uterus. Its potency was less than that of oxytocin and acetylcholine (P&lt;0.05), but the Emax showed no significant difference (P&gt;0.05). The Emax values of the extract in the presence of all antagonists were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.01).

In CD-induced model obesity was induced by feeding CD for 48-days and increase in body weight and fat storage was suppressed co-administration with methanolic extract of Clerodendrum phlomidis (MECP) at 400 mg/kg. Blood analysis showed that the levels of triglyceride and cholesterol were significantly lowered by MECP administration and there is subsequent rise in HDLcholesterol level. From this experiment, we demonstrated that MECP is effective in ameliorating the CD-induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulimenia, dyslepidemia, increase in wet weight of white adipose tissue, and hypertrophy of fat cells. In drug induced obesity model hyperphagia was induced by progesterone (10 mg/kg s.c.) for 28 days and was suppressed by co-administration with MECP in dose dependent manner. It is tempting to speculate that these protective effects shown by Clerodendrum phlomidis is by multiple mechanisms. MECP contains β-sitosterol in the abundant quantity because of the structural similarity it do the physical competition with natural sterols while absorption of food stuffs from GIT and moreover the crude saponin and flavonoid has been reported for it’s the appétit suppressant property and hence reduces hyperphagia produced by progesterone.

However, there is no scientific evidence on the hepatoprotective potential of the plant. Aim: The present study was aimed at evaluating the hepatoprotective and antioxidant potential of the aqueous alcoholic (70%) extract of Rhodomyrtus tomentosa leaves (RTLE) based on its traditional claim in liver diseases. Materials and Methods: Hepatotoxicity was induced in albino rats by administering a combination of three antitubercular drugs, Isoniazid (7.5 mg/kg), Pyrazinamide (35 mg/kg) and Rifampicin (10 mg/kg) orally for 45 days. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Aspartate amino transferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total protein and total bilirubin (TB) levels were estimated in serum samples using diagnostic kits. Antioxidant parameters were estimated in liver homogenates using standard methods. Statistical Analysis: The experimental mean values were compared statistically with that of toxicant group by using One‑way ANOVA followed by Newman‑Keul’s multiple tests. Results: Hepatoprotective activity of the extract was evident from the significant decrease in the elevated levels of ALT, AST, ALP and total bilirubin and an increase in the levels of total protein in comparison to toxicant control. Increased activity of antioxidant enzymes supports the in vivo antioxidant activity of the extract. Histopathological changes of the liver in the treated and control group of rats were in agreement with the hepatoprotective finding. Conclusion: RTLE exhibited hepatoprotective activity against antitubercular drug induced hepatotoxicity through a free radical scavenging effect and reduces oxidative damage caused by antitubercular drugs.

Several parts of the plant are used to treat a variety of diseases, but the most important is the fruit. Many ailments are treated by the fruit which is used either alone or in combination with other plants. These include common cold and fever; as a diuretic, laxative, liver tonic, refrigerant, stomachic, restorative, alterative, antipyretic, anti‑inflammatory, hair tonic; to prevent peptic ulcer and dyspepsia, and as a digestive. E. officinalis possesses antipyretic, analgesic, antitussive, antiatherogenic, adaptogenic, cardioprotective, gastroprotective, antianemic, antihypercholesterolemic, wound healing, antidiarrheal, antiatherosclerotic, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, and neuroprotective properties as demonstrated in numerous preclinical studies. Furthermore, experimental studies have reported that E. officinalis and some of its phytochemicals also exhibit anticarcinogenic properties. E. officinalis is also reported to possess radiomodulatory, chemomodulatory, chemopreventive, free radical scavenging, antioxidant, anti‑inflammatory, antimutagenic and immunomodulatory activities. These properties are efficacious in the treatment and prevention of cancer.

This review identifies patient-centered practices that ensure safety and reduce risk of infection transmission to health care workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.MethodsConsensus statements, guidelines, institutional recommendations, and scientific literature on COVID-19 and previous outbreaks were reviewed. A global interdisciplinary team analyzed and prioritized findings via electronic communications and video conferences to develop consensus recommendations.ResultsAerosol-generating procedures are commonly performed by nurses and other health care workers, most notably during suctioning, tracheostomy tube changes, and stoma care. Patient repositioning, readjusting circuits, administering nebulized medications, and patient transport also present risks. Standard personal protective equipment includes an N95/FFP3 mask with or without surgical masks, gloves, goggles, and gown when performing aerosol-generating procedures for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Viral testing of bronchial aspirate via tracheostomy may inform care providers when determining the protective equipment required. The need for protocols to reduce risk of transmission of infection to nurses and other health care workers is evident.ConclusionCritical care nurses and multidisciplinary teams often care for patients with a tracheostomy who are known or suspected to have COVID-19. Appropriate care of these patients relies on safeguarding the health care team. The practices described in this review may greatly reduce risk of infectious transmission.       The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic coincides with the culmination of the World Health Organization Nursing Now Campaign1&nbsp; and the bicentennial of Florence Nightingale’s birth.2-5&nbsp; The timing is significant because critical care nurses at the forefront of life-saving efforts are also at risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 during tracheostomy care.6, 7&nbsp; High risks of viral aerosolization attend both the tracheotomy procedure in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and the subsequent tracheostomy management during weaning and after liberation from the ventilator.8, 9&nbsp; Therefore, it is important for nurses and other providers caring for patients to protect themselves from harm.10&nbsp; In this article, we summarize current evidence on caring for patients with a tracheostomy, outlining state-of-the-art consensus guidance while also acknowledging the challenges inherent in providing such care in low-resource health systems.11&nbsp;   “Critical care nurses at the forefront of life-saving efforts are also at risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 during tracheostomy care.”  Methods   A search for relevant studies was conducted in the PubMed, CINAHL Plus, Embase, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases. Keywords included coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS, tracheostomy, tracheotomy, nursing, ventilator, and critical care. Studies were included if they assessed aerosol-generating procedures or tracheostomy and were published in English between January 1 and May 31, 2020, to coincide with the COVID-19 pandemic. The internet (Google and Google Scholar search engines) and gray literature were also searched for recent evidence and expert opinions in the forms of national and global guidance. Content experts in tracheostomy from various disciplines, including nursing, anesthesia and critical care, surgery, respiratory therapy, and speech-language pathology from different continents, were identified, with increased representation from nursing in the areas of critical care and otolaryngology. Contributors reviewed content and quality of the studies independently; discrepancies were adjudicated through iterative discussion via email, phone, and video conference until consensus was reached. Key concepts related to tracheostomy included timing and location for procedure, tracheostomy tube sizing and type, cuff management, humidification, tracheostomy tube and stoma care, suctioning, nebulization, positioning, tube changes, transportation, speech, rehabilitation, decannulation, resuscitation, and ethical considerations.   Transmission, Pathogenesis, and Clinical Course of COVID-19   The high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is evident in the global spread of infection.12, 13&nbsp; SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted through droplets generated by speech, coughing, and sneezing but may be found in blood, feces, urine, and semen.13-16&nbsp; The pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 involves several steps. SARS-CoV-2 enters the respiratory tract, causes respiratory cells to lyse, and infects nearby cells, initiating a cytokine storm. Activated neutrophils release inter leukins (namely, interleukin-2, -7, and -10), leuko trienes, platelet-activating factors, oxidants, proteases, and tumor necrosis factor-α.17&nbsp; These factors, in turn, increase alveolar-capillary membrane permeability, allowing fluid to leak into alveolar sacs and preventing gas exchange, resulting in hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates (ie, interstitial pneumonitis). Patients typically present with fever, shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue. When patients’ illness progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation is required, sometimes necessitating tracheostomy, and some patients will experience ensuing progressive multiple organ dysfunction.17-20&nbsp;   “Nurses and others assisting in the procedure should wear a fit-tested N95 mask, powered air-purifying respirator, or equivalent (filtering facepiece 3 [FFP3]) with or without a surgical mask and face shield.”   Considerations While Caring for a Patient With a Tracheostomy   Timing of a Tracheostomy   Patients critically ill with COVID-19 often require prolonged ventilatory support and are at risk of critical illness myopathy and neuropathy, requiring prolonged weaning and rehabilitation via tracheostomy.17-19, 21, 22&nbsp; The timing of tracheostomy is controversial because the virus, even when inert and unable to grow in culture, may be amplified beyond 30 days (range, 8-37 days; median, 20 days; interquartile range, 17-24 days).22, 23&nbsp; Waiting until viral loads decrease may reduce risk to health care workers24&nbsp;; however, such delays also present challenges. Prolonged deferral of tracheostomy when clinically indicated limits pulmonary hygiene, impedes efforts to decrease sedation, and may predispose to cognitive impairments or nosocomial complications, in addition to exacerbating the strain on intensive care unit bed capacity.25&nbsp; Prolonged intubation also interferes with normal voice and swallowing functions, as well as predisposing to laryngeal injuries, such as posterior glottis injury or subglottic stenosis.26&nbsp; Early in the pandemic, Takhar et al27&nbsp; observed that many patients positive for COVID-19 were extubated within 5 to 10 days after intubation. Building on this observation and integrating subsequent evidence, a multinational work group with expertise in nursing critical care, pulmonary, anesthesiology, intensive care medicine, otolaryngology, virology, and infectious disease partnered with medical ethicists and patient and family stakeholders. After evaluating clinical data and the timeline of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and immune response, this broad-based team arrived at a recommendation of 10 to 21 days postintubation for tracheostomy.28&nbsp;   Setting Where Procedure Performed   Tracheostomy for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation is performed in the operating room or at the bedside in intensive care units. The safety risk of transmission while transporting patients positive for COVID-19 to operating rooms must be considered.29, 30&nbsp; Procedures are ideally performed by experienced specialists in negative-pressure rooms equipped with high-efficiency particulate air filter using time-out and checklists (&nbsp;Appendix).31-37&nbsp; For patients negative for COVID-19, considerations of acuity and presence of a difficult airway may influence location. Experience from the 2003 era of severe acute respiratory syndrome favored an open surgical technique out of concern for aerosolization during bronchoscopy; however, percutaneous techniques have progressed significantly, and there currently are no data indicating superior safety profile with open versus percutaneous techniques.28, 38&nbsp;   Preparing for a Tracheostomy   Regardless of the procedure technique or location, tracheostomy is a high-risk, aerosol-generating procedure; therefore, nurses and others assisting in the procedure should wear a fit-tested N95 mask, powered air-purifying respirator, or equivalent (filtering facepiece 3 [FFP3]) with or without a surgical mask and face shield.24, 36, 39, 40&nbsp; A trained health care professional should monitor donning and doffing for quality assurance.41&nbsp; Meticulous collection of equipment (&nbsp;Appendix) is crucial to avoid multiple re-entries into procedure areas and unnecessary donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) (see Table).42&nbsp; A dry run with the operating team before the procedure (using simulation centers,43&nbsp; if available) clarifies all team members’ roles, responsibilities, and technique, with a senior operator per-forming the procedure to ensure efficiency and minimize exposure.24, 44-47&nbsp;   Size and Type of Initial Tracheostomy Tube   The size of the initial tracheostomy tube is chosen on the basis of several factors: the patient’s airway anatomy, the need to facilitate early phonation, and the risk for development of granulation tissue. Selection of a tube of the appropriate size is particularly important during COVID-19 to create a smaller stoma to reduce aerosolization,44&nbsp; facilitate bronchial hygiene,27&nbsp; reduce tracheostomy tube changes, and minimize ventilator leak around the cuff. A computed tomographic scan of the neck or chest provides measurement distance from skin to cricoid cartilage, aiding tube selection. If distance from skin to cricoid cartilage is greater than 4 cm, an extended-length tracheostomy tube may decrease need for additional tracheostomy tube changes.48&nbsp; Ultrasound can also aid evaluation of anatomy and be useful during the procedure.49&nbsp; Disposable inner-cannula tubes allow easier maintenance and decrease prolonged exposure to viral particles.28&nbsp;   “A closed suction-circuit system reduces expulsion of aerosolized viral particles from positive-pressure ventilation.”   Tracheostomy Tube Cuff Management   Tracheostomy tube cuff pressures are typically maintained between 20 and 30 cm H 2O but may be slightly increased to obtain a better seal,28, 50&nbsp; bearing in mind that daily duties such as in-bed bathing and raising the head of the bed to 30° may alter pressures.51&nbsp; Low pressure increases the risk of microaspiration of upper airway secretions, leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia as well as aerosol-generating ventilation leak. Risk of tracheal stenosis, tracheomalacia, or tracheal necrosis developing increases with higher cuff pressures.52&nbsp; Therefore, cuff pressure should be checked at least once per shift. Using minimum occlusion volume or minimal leak techniques, which are often used in low-resource settings, is discouraged because of aerosol generation. If these techniques are used in the absence of a manometer, then the clinician should wear an N95 (FFP3) mask or equivalent, gloves, goggles, and a face shield, and the patient should wear a surgical mask.   “A surgical mask is placed on the face and over the tracheostomy tube to reduce the potential for viral spread via respiratory droplets.”   Humidification   Because the tracheostomy bypasses the upper airway’s humidification, the standard of care is to ensure humidification. In patients with COVID-19, certain humidification devices should be used with caution, however. To minimize risk of viral particles being sprayed, use of pressurized cooled or heated aerosols is discouraged.28, 53&nbsp; Humidification is best provided by either an active (heated) pass-over humidifier with a bacterial and viral filter on the exhaust limb or port or a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) with built-in filter, if available.54-57&nbsp; Most HMEs are not equipped with filters to prevent transmission of viral particles. Therefore, when caring for patients with a tracheostomy, health care workers should be alerted to this common limitation and take precautions to minimize risk of viral exposure.58&nbsp; The patient’s hydration status and need for enteral mucolytic agents should also be assessed to minimize risk of occlusion from tenacious secretions.   Tracheostomy Tube Care   Cleaning stomas, dressing changes, cleaning or changing the inner cannula, and changing tracheostomy ties may all expose nurses to aerosolized particles. Therefore, performing these procedures on the basis of patient need is preferable to performing them at routine, scheduled intervals.53, 54&nbsp; Secretions of patients infected with COVID-19 may be of high volume, however, thus contributing to stomal inflammation and overall viral load if not carefully monitored. Careful assessment of the stoma site using an interdisciplinary care protocol, therefore, is imperative.59&nbsp; Patency of tracheostomy tubes is confirmed by passing inline suction through a closed circuit, ensuring that the suction catheter passes freely beyond the distal tip of the tracheostomy tube without sticking or blockage.   Tracheostomy Suctioning: Closed Versus Open Circuit   For patients receiving mechanical ventilatory support, a closed suction-circuit system (Figure 1A) reduces expulsion of aerosolized viral particles from positive-pressure ventilation.54, 55, 60&nbsp; If the patient does not require mechanical ventilation, a T-piece using an HME with expiratory filter may be used to maintain a closed system (Figure 1B).61, 62&nbsp; Suctioning requirements are usually increased during the first 48 hours after tracheostomy.63&nbsp; Saline instillation is used sparingly or even avoided to prevent aerosolization and water-logging of the HME in the ventilator circuit.64, 65&nbsp; Nurses need to assess suctioning needs and communicate with physicians or advanced practice providers to ensure appropriate orders for safe treatment of patients.   Inhaled Medication Administration   Administering medications via nebulizer through tracheostomy collars generates even more aerosol than most other aerosol-generating procedures (Figure 2).67-69&nbsp; Nebulized medication delivery is discouraged because it causes sideways leakage of exhaled air, and dispersion distance increases with lung injury. Dispersion distance is 45 cm in the normal lung, 54 cm in mild lung injury, and 80 cm in severe lung injury.70&nbsp; Vibrating mesh nebulizers that do not require disconnection of ventilator circuits are preferred for administering medications.71&nbsp; Metered-dose inhalation is best administered via a spacer attached directly to the tracheostomy tube in patients not receiving mechanical ventilatory support or via ventilator circuit in those who are (Figure 2).66, 71-81&nbsp;   Managing the Tracheostomy During Proning   COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome involves a vascular injury; disrupted vasoregulation may influence critical care strategy. Prone ventilation82&nbsp; improves oxygenation and reduces lung atelectasis83&nbsp; but introduces unique new challenges.84&nbsp; Prone positioning is an effective intervention for acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 during noninvasive85&nbsp; and invasive mechanical ventilation.86&nbsp; An increasing number of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19 required prone positioning, which posed a challenge to the nurses. A rehabilitation-based prone team has been suggested to assist with prone positioning of patients.87&nbsp; Prone position has been suggested for use in the early phase of severe hypoxemia in patients without a tracheostomy but has been necessary for patients with COVID-19 who have been admitted with a tracheostomy from a skilled-nursing facility or long-term acute care facility. In this case, particular attention has to be given to the those with a tracheostomy, because it is not easy to identify tracheostomy tube displacement. The patient’s head should be aligned properly with padding around the tracheostomy tube, and extra tubing may be needed to ensure airway patency and access for suctioning. Suturing the tracheostomy tube may also need be considered to decrease tracheostomy tube displacement. Thus, specific challenges have to be considered and monitored when proning a patient with a tracheostomy.   “Lack of PPE, rationing of ventilators, inability to isolate patients, and fear of contracting COVID-19 all may render nurses susceptible to moral distress or injury.”   Tracheostomy Tube Changes   The frequency of elective tracheostomy tube changes varies by institution.88&nbsp; Some centers perform weekly or biweekly tracheostomy changes in patients with resistant infections, to assist in decreasing bacterial or viral load. Others may perform less frequent changes to avoid risking loss of airway or airway injury. Institutions that practice tracheostomy tube changes more regularly may consider decreasing frequency to reduce nurses’ exposure to aerosolized particles.50&nbsp; Waiting 29 days is suggested, on the basis of manufacturing guidelines, unless earlier change of the tube is clinically warranted.65, 89&nbsp; This standard may impede timely transition to skilled nursing homes and long-term acute care hospitals that expect the first tracheostomy tube change to be performed by health care providers in acute care hospitals. Communication with the receiving institution is crucial for timely and safe transitioning, especially amid limited hospital-bed capacity.   Transporting Patients   The tracheostomy tube cuff should be inflated to maintain a closed system when transporting patients receiving mechanical ventilatory support with a tracheostomy within or between hospitals. For patients not receiving mechanical ventilatory support, an HME with viral filter may be placed on the tracheostomy tube, and a surgical mask is placed on the face and over the tracheostomy tube to reduce the potential for viral spread via respiratory droplets. Preplanning, collecting equipment, and effective communication ensure patient and staff safety.90-93&nbsp;   Speech and Augmentative Communication   Restoring ability to communicate greatly decreases anxiety and improves patient and family experience. Augmentative and alternative communication devices, smartphones, and tablets are first-line methods of communication for patients with COVID-19. Cuff deflation for insertion of an inline, one-way speaking valve in patients receiving mechanical ventilatory support results in aerosol generation; therefore, it is generally discouraged. If cuff deflation is necessary to perform cognitive assessments or to facilitate end-of-life discussions, transient cuff deflation may be considered.94&nbsp; During cuff deflation, the patient should wear a face mask to reduce the distances that aerosols can travel. Because patients not receiving mechanical ventilatory support have an open-circuit system, the cuff may be deflated to facilitate speech by either digital occlusion or a one-way speaking valve. Nevertheless, speech can generate aerosols. Nurses should wear surgical masks while communicating with patients with deflated cuffs and should maintain social distancing to minimize viral exposure.95, 96&nbsp;   Rehabilitation of Patients With COVID-19   Even after patients recover from COVID-19 critical illness, residual multisystem sequelae often persist. Rehabilitation aims to improve respiration, swallowing, mobility, cognition, emotional adjustment, and overall quality of life while reducing complications and disability.97&nbsp; During acute hospitalization, early respiratory rehabilitation is highly recommended. Strategies include noninvasive ventilation, frequent changes in position, and passive range of motion. It is important to gradually increase patients’ anti-gravity position until an upright position can be maintained.97&nbsp; Staff protection with an N95 mask or equivalent with or without surgical masks, gloves, and goggles or a face shield should continue en route to the rehabilitation environment until the patient is confirmed noninfectious.   Tracheostomy Decannulation   When the underlying reason for a tracheostomy tube has resolved, capping trials and decannulation should be approached conservatively in patients with COVID-19.28&nbsp; Often, lung injury is severe in COVID-19; therefore, the patient should be monitored in an outpatient setting with tracheostomy in situ until healing of lung injury is confirmed. Viral polymerase chain reaction assay or antibody testing may guide downsizing, capping, and decannulating of tracheostomy tubes.98-101&nbsp; When a patient is ready for down-sizing and decannulation, appropriate PPE ensures protection from aerosolized particles (see Table).   Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation of Patients With a Tracheostomy   Data from Wuhan, China, on patients who experienced cardiac arrest (n = 136) showed that 87.5% of cardiac arrests had an underlying respiratory cause; for most (89.7%), the initial rhythm for cardiac arrest was asystole. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 13.2% of patients (n = 18), with few alive at 30 days.102&nbsp; The appropriateness of initiating and continuing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be considered early in patients’ care, in line with patients’ values and goals,103, 104&nbsp; and if the critical care team deems that CPR does not offer physiologic benefit, it may be withheld.105&nbsp;   If a prone-positioned patient with a tracheostomy requires CPR, the prone position is maintained to prevent loss of airway.104, 106-108&nbsp; Conducting CPR in patients with COVID-19 is an intermediate-risk exposure event for clinicians.105&nbsp; The cause of acute deterioration in condition may be a readily reversible airway occlusion, such as a mucous plug or malposition of the tracheostomy tube in patients with a tracheostomy; therefore, an urgent assessment of mechanical airway obstruction is warranted. Nurses should provide CPR even when some personal risk is present103, 105, 109&nbsp; but only after donning appropriate PPE to ensure safety.104&nbsp; A bag-mask valve should be used with a filter to decrease exposure during resuscitation.   Ethical Considerations   Few subjects are more fraught with fear than allocation of scarce resources amid a pandemic and duty to serve in instances that harbor risk for health care workers. The overarching principle of primum non nocere, “First, do no harm,” must consider the safety of patients and health care workers and societal needs. Opinions differ on how prevailing standards of care may be modified in the setting of a pandemic or other crisis; these issues have immediate relevance to care of patients with tracheostomy, whether in timing of the procedure or whether to perform CPR in a patient with progressive decline. Reconciling the benefits and countervailing risks of invasive care for patients and health care workers is an ongoing pro-cess.110&nbsp; In the United Kingdom, clinicians were advised not to resuscitate patients with COVID-19 who had cardiac arrest in the hospital outside the emergency department, noting the poor prognosis and the aerosol-generating risk of CPR.111&nbsp; Nurses and clinicians should identify reversible causes of arrest, such as an occluded tracheostomy tube.   Lack of PPE, rationing of ventilators, inability to isolate patients, and fear of contracting COVID-19 all may render nurses susceptible to moral distress or injury. Inability to allow family to visit patients, particularly when communication is limited by restrictions on cuff deflation, also amplifies distress. The strain of bearing witness to critically ill patients is not new to intensive care unit nurses, but the suffering of patients with COVID-19, many of whom undergo tracheostomy, is increased during surges. These clinical realities are superimposed on providers’ exhaustion from wearing PPE for prolonged periods, difficulty connecting with patients through protective gear, and fatigue from increased demands amid staff shortages.112&nbsp; Organizational efforts are needed to mitigate moral distress and foster resilience.   Considerations for Low-Resource Health Systems   Challenges in safely treating patients with tracheostomy in low-resource settings include staff training, inadequate PPE, insufficient functioning ventilators or repairs, lack of medical oxygen, short supply of suction devices, and reliance on nonsterile suction catheters that are washed and reused between patients.113-118&nbsp; Despite these constraints, remarkable ingenuity by critical care nurses and hospitals allows most evidence-based recommendations presented herein to be tailored for implementation within local protocols,119&nbsp; with notable caveats in conventional sterilization techniques, limited testing, and lack of isolation rooms.120-122&nbsp; Examples of ingenuity include gloves made from plastic materials melted in home-made heated molds, cutting 5-gallon water bottles into vented full-coverage face shields, and evidence-based substitution for infection control (eg, soaking used gloves in special available detergents).123&nbsp;   Conclusion   Nurses have a critical role during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when caring for patients with a tracheostomy. These guidelines address gaps in the literature and carefully ensure patient and staff safety. Aerosol generation and exposure risk can be minimized through use of closed systems, appropriate PPE, and other mindful practices. For low-resource countries, international recommendations, including protocols, may need to be adapted to the local context. Nurses and other health care team members need to care for themselves to optimize their physical and emotional health amidst a distressing and demanding environment. By working collaboratively to optimize care and by adhering to best practice in COVID-19 management, the dual goals of patient-centered care and health care worker safety can be ensured.

After rapid spread of the disease across China and to several countries, 1&nbsp; the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency on January 30, 2020, followed by a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.   Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are widespread among birds and mammals and cause a variety of illnesses. The virus that causes COVID-19 is an enveloped single-strand RNA zoonotic virus associated with a severe respiratory syndrome. 2&nbsp; Spread occurs via human-to-human transmission primarily by inhalation of large respiratory droplets associated with coughing, sneezing, singing, or talking (these heavy droplets may travel 6 feet [1.8 m] or more but fall relatively quickly), or tiny aerosolized particles ( 80%), but severe (14%) and critical (5%) cases required hospital admission and intensive care. Some patients’ condition deteriorated rapidly within 1 week of illness onset. 4&nbsp; Severe cases were characterized by dyspnea, respiratory rate greater than 30/min, oxygen saturation less than 93%, and lung infiltrates exceeding 50% within 24 to 48 hours of illness onset; critical cases involved respiratory failure, sepsis, and/or multiple organ dysfunction. Mortality rates were estimated at 2.3% of confirmed cases. 9&nbsp; Major risk factors for severe disease and mortality include increasing age and various comorbidities (eg, hypertension, heart disease, prior stroke, diabetes, chronic lung and kidney disease, immunosuppression). 1, 2, 4, 8, 10&nbsp;   Absent a vaccine and effective treatment, research has been focused on developing COVID-19 diagnostic and antibody tests and on testing therapies such as remdesivir, convalescent plasma, and the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which are also used for autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. Given that little evidence is available on therapies for COVID-19, the PICO (patient problem, intervention, comparison, and outcome) question for this evidence synthesis was, Is chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine safe and effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and disease mortality?  Methods   The strategy included searching EMBASE. Key words included COVID-19, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, efficacy, safety, randomized controlled trial (RCT), and critical illness. The search was limited to RCTs or systematic reviews published in 2020.   Results   Table 1 outlines findings of 5 studies. Of these, 1 was a retrospective cohort study, 2 were systematic reviews, and 2 were randomized controlled trials. An in vitro study included in one of the systematic reviews 13&nbsp; demonstrated that chloroquine blocks the virus by increasing pH in endosomes and interfering with glycosylation in the virus’ cellular response and subsequently reduces viral replication. In a small randomized controlled trial (N = 62), researchers found that COVID patients treated with hydroxychloroquine had less progression to severe disease, more improvement in pneumonia, and shortened recovery intervals for fever and cough. 12&nbsp; Other clinical studies in one systematic review reported favorable outcomes of treatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine; however, conclusions regarding safety and efficacy were severely limited by poor designs and study bias. 15&nbsp; In another randomized controlled trial 14&nbsp; and some studies in one systematic review, 15&nbsp; researchers found no difference in negative conversion between control group patients and those treated with hydroxychloroquine. No significant difference in mortality among COVID patients treated with hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, either hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin alone, or neither drug was found in the single cohort study. 11&nbsp;   Recommendations for Practice   All of the evidence available is level C (Table 2). In vitro, chloroquine appears to block the virus’ ability to bind to cells and to reduce viral replication; it also seems to suppress aggressive immune responses in some patients. 13&nbsp; Clinically, these drugs have been associated with favorable outcomes in a few trials, 12, 15&nbsp; but data on harms have been mixed. Tang et al 14 reported greater adverse outcomes in patients receiving chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Rosenberg and colleagues 11&nbsp; reported an increased risk of cardiac arrest associated with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, but no significant mortality differences between treatment arms in a large cohort (N > 7900). Conclusions from these cohort findings are limited because of the study’s observational nature.   Because of emerging safety concerns, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning in late April 2020 about use of hydroxychloroquine in off-label and nonresearch situations. 17&nbsp; Then in late May 2020, a large multinational observational study 18&nbsp; (N > 96 000) showed that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were each associated with an elevated risk of not only cardiotoxic effects including QT prolongation and new ventricular arrythmias (4%-8% vs 0.3% in controls), but also in-hospital mortality (16%-24% vs 9% in controls). Although researchers reported that study participants’ characteristics were accounted for statistically, critics argued that many factors may have contributed to the reported differences in mortality. For example, physicians may have been more likely to prescribe chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for patients with severe disease and thus those patients who were given the drugs may already have been at greater risk of mortality. 19&nbsp; This publication was later retracted after researchers could not guarantee the veracity of data included in the analysis. 20&nbsp; But, authors of this retraction contended that prolonged ventricular repolarization that can lead to ventricular arrythmias has long been substantiated with anti-malarials. These authors further advocated that administering these agents in patients with COVID-19 further elevates the danger of serious cardiac events due to associated disease-related factors that increase the probability of drug-induced pro-arrhythmias (ie, hypokalemia, fever, increased interleukin-6 concentrations, coadministration of other QT-prolonging drugs).   On June 15, 2020, the FDA then revoked its emergency authorization for use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for hospitalized patients when clinical trials were unavailable or participation was not feasible. 17, 21&nbsp; Additionally, on June 17, 2020, the World Health Organization stopped the hydroxychloroquine arm of the international Solidarity trial evaluating treatments for hospitalized COVID patients because of the lack of observed mortality reductions and associated safety concerns. 22&nbsp; The ORCHID trial (Outcomes Related to COVID-19 Treated With Hydroxychloroquine Among Inpatients With Symptomatic Disease) was also halted in mid-June 2020 because no evidence of harm or benefit was observed. 23&nbsp;   Currently, scientists continue studying numerous treatments for COVID-19 in ongoing clinical trials. More than 100 off-label drugs with antiviral or anti-inflammatory properties are being tested to determine their clinical safety and efficacy against COVID-19. 24, 25&nbsp; Some of these potentially promising treatments include the following:    Convalescent plasma–Transfusion of plasma from recovered COVID victims to boost patients’ immune systems with antibodies that may help them fight the disease more effectively;Remdesivir–An intravenous agent with broad antiviral activity whose therapeutic efficacy was first described for Ebola 25&nbsp;;Dexamethasone–A steroid that may quell the inflammatory cascade of severe disease is showing promising reductions in 28-day mortality; however, results of the RECOVERY trial are pending. Risks and benefits of steroid administration will need to be considered for each individual patient 25– 27&nbsp;;Tocilizumab–A monoclonal antibody that blocks the interleukin-6 signaling pathway that may ameliorate the cytokine release syndrome seen in COVID. 25, 28&nbsp; Researchers in an observational study reported that tocilizumab was associated with a decreased risk of mechanical ventilation and mortality in patients with severe cases of COVID-19. 29&nbsp;   Although the verdict is out on the safety and efficacy of various treatments for COVID-19, science strongly suggests the antimalarial agents’ chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine cause more harm than benefit in the context of COVID-19.

Clinicians are called to care for patients in the face of much fear and uncertainty. As Catherine Barnette wrote in her poem “Epistemology,” we all want to “feel a little less, know a little more.”2&nbsp;   What we know and how we know it will be put to the test more than ever during these times. Already, a PubMed search for COVID-19 reveals more than 5000 articles either in press or already published since the beginning of the crisis. And yet, in the face of so many publications, it will be important that we think critically about which publications are presenting new knowledge and which are not; it will be important that we think critically about which new knowledge is ready for application to clinical practice and which is not.   The controversy surrounding the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 is emblematic of the challenge of discerning what we know. On the basis of in vitro data that suggested hydroxychloroquine had viral suppression activity against coronaviruses,3&nbsp; some clinicians began prescribing hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients and publishing anecdotal impressions of its effectiveness.4&nbsp; In an effort to examine this more systematically, several studies were started that aimed at testing the potential efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19. Recently, an article about an open-label, nonrandomized trial that tested the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin at reducing viral clearance was published ahead of print.5&nbsp; The study had several flaws, however. First, it was not a randomized controlled trial, and the 16 participants included in the control group differed from the 20 patients included in the treatment group; patients who refused to participate in the hydroxychloroquine intervention were included in the “controls”; patients from 3 other centers were also added as controls whereas all treated patients were from a single center. Second, investigators were not blinded to the treatment allocation, and they did not describe the cointerventions the patients received during the study. Third, the patients were not analyzed in the groups to which they were assigned: patients who got hydroxychloroquine but transferred to an intensive care unit were excluded from the analyses; patients who got hydroxychloroquine but later died were excluded from the analyses; patients who got hydroxychloroquine but stopped the treatment because of symptoms or were discharged from the hospital before the study end point were excluded from the analyses. The study reported that by day 7, 70% of the patients analyzed within the hydroxychloroquine treatment arm had negative results on a viral assay (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) compared with 12.5% in the group that had refused the study drug. In discussing their results, the authors boldly suggested that “COVID-19 patients be treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to cure … infection and to limit the transmission.”5&nbsp;   “Even in pandemic times, randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) should still be the gold standard approach for determining the efficacy of a drug treatment.”   Even before the open-label trial of hydroxychloroquine was published, political leaders in the United States and pundits were expressing their excitement about hydroxychloroquine’s potential to be a “game-changing” treatment for COVID-19. Many medical centers started to protocolize the use of hydroxychloroquine in their treatment protocols for COVID-19. We believe that such a rush to systematically implement treatments before they have been rigorously tested will not serve our patients well. Even in pandemic times, randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) should still be the gold standard approach for determining the efficacy of a drug treatment.   If we rush to overuse hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients on the basis of flawed data, we risk exposing our patients to known complications of the drug such as ventricular arrythmias or sudden cardiac death.6&nbsp; With the overuse of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients, patients who depend on the drug to control their autoimmune diseases (for which the drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration) have experienced trouble getting access and skyrocketing prices. If in choosing to use hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, we neglect to rigorously test other potentially effective treatments, then we will have missed an opportunity to impart new knowledge to the care of future patients with COVID-19.   Indeed, there are real challenges to conducting rigorous RCTs during a pandemic. In normal circumstances, RCTs are expensive, are cumbersome, and can be too slow to diffuse results into practice.7,8&nbsp; Treatment protocols in RCTs are often not flexible enough to account for the heterogeneity (ie, subphenotypes) in disease presentation.9&nbsp; Adequate informed consent for research participation is made more difficult during a pandemic: the emotional distress of the patients and families may preclude adequate exchange of information; in situations where patients are unable to consent for themselves, surrogates may be harder to find because most hospitals have had to limit family visits in order to decrease community spread of the infection. The high level of uncertainty and fear during a pandemic may make patients, surrogates, and clinicians more averse to the inherent ambiguity of randomization.10&nbsp;   Nevertheless, modern innovations in clinical trial design make rigorous clinical trials during this pandemic more feasible than ever before. Adaptive trials, for example, allow for changes in the study protocol over time based on new information (eg, in the inclusion/exclusion criteria or the proportion of participants randomized to a control group).8&nbsp; Platform trial design expands the scope of a trial from one intervention to a suite of interventions, allowing comparisons between many interventions within different treatment domains for a disease or syndrome.8&nbsp; The Randomized Embedded, Multifactorial Adaptive Platform for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP) trial is one such recent trial that is enrolling COVID-19 patients around the world to quickly answer many treatment questions.11&nbsp; Patients who are eligible for participation in REMAP-CAP will be randomized to receive one intervention in each category of treatment (eg, type of antibiotic, antiviral treatment, steroid use). The study protocol allows data that are already accrued in the study to be used to change the randomization ratio to increase the chance that the patient is assigned to a likely beneficial treatment. Any specific treatment arm of the study will be terminated when enough data have accrued rather than after a specific sample size is reached, which allows new questions to be quickly integrated into the same trial platform.   We recognize that clinical action based only on the highest empirical evidence will not always be feasible.12&nbsp; We will be called to act on the basis of our clinical experience and expertise. We will be called to act on the basis of our understanding of pathophysiology: of how the virus works, the pathobiology of sepsis or of acute respiratory distress syndrome. We will be called to act on the basis of our understanding of our patients (who they are and what they value). We will be asked to change what we do on the basis of systemic factors that are beyond our control such as how many ventilators are available in the hospital or whether a nurse is available to do a particular kind of dialysis in a patient with acute renal failure. However, treatment decisions based on flawed data that then become entrenched into clinical care are inherently dangerous. Our patients deserve an honest effort by researchers to generate the highest quality data on treatment efficacy. Even in the fog of this pandemic, during which much will remain a mystery, our patients deserve an honest and humble appraisal of the new medical evidence.   “Treatment decisions based on flawed data that then become entrenched into clinical care are inherently dangerous.”  REFERENCES   REFERENCES1Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, et al.

Findings did not support accumulation of CHG but did show evidence of higher absorption than previously reported. Results of liver and renal function studies remained within reference limits. No patient had any adverse events, including skin reactions.ConclusionsAlthough no adverse events were observed, our patients had evidence of CHG absorption. The effects of this absorption remain unknown. More research is needed to determine safe blood levels of CHG in infants less than 2 months of age.         ©2019 American Association of Critical-Care Nurses2019    ","year":"2019","createdAt":"2020-09-29T09:16:57.421Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-29T09:16:57.421Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f72fb89f4156d4a2e496897","title":"Effects of Sepsis on Morbidity and Mortality in Critically Ill Patients 2 Years After Intensive Care Unit Discharge","link":"https://aacnjournals.org/ajcconline/article/28/6/424/22000/Effects-of-Sepsis-on-Morbidity-and-Mortality-in?searchresult=1","abstract":"  BackgroundMorbidity and mortality after discharge from an intensive care unit appear to be higher in patients with sepsis than in patients without sepsis.ObjectiveTo evaluate morbidity and mortality in patients with and without sepsis within 2 years after intensive care unit discharge.MethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted in 2 intensive care units.

The incidence of reported pneumothoraces associated with EMPD-assisted FT insertion was compared with that for blind FT insertion. This study is aligned with the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses’ mission to drive excellence and rely on expert knowledge and skill.   Background/Significance   A 2018 letter from the US Food and Drug Administration warned clinicians about the risk for pneumothoraces during FT insertion despite the use of an EMPD. The incidence of pneumothoraces during blind FT insertions (1.3%-3.2%) is thought to be underreported. Unfortunately, FT insertion into the pulmonary system may occur without clinical signs. Pneumothoraces associated with FT insertion have led to patient death. EMPD’s real-time insertion tracing can assist a trained operator with early recognition of pulmonary placement.   Method   An integrative review of the literature on EMPD-assisted FT insertion was performed using the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases. Inclusion criteria consisted of research, Cortrak-assisted FT insertion, reported FT outcomes, human study participants (adult and pediatric), and English language. Nonresearch or studies that focused on gastric motility were excluded. Sixty-three studies were screened and 32 were included in the final analysis. Twenty-nine studies reported explicitly on the presence or absence of pulmonary FT placement.   Result   Pulmonary placement occurred in 209 out of 19 217 FT insertions; 202 (1.05%) were observed on the CORTRAK insertion tracing and 7 (0.04%) were confirmed by a non-EMPD method. Of the studies that reported pulmonary placement, 3 out of 17 039 (0.02%) insertions resulted in pneumothoraces. EMPD operators failed to identify 2 of these pulmonary placements, which were later confirmed by radiography. Skilled operators prevented 199 out of 202 (99%) FTs from being inserted into distal airways by immediate FT removal once pulmonary placement was suspected on the basis of the EMPD insertion tracing.   Conclusion   Pneumothorax occurred less often with EMPD-assisted FT insertion (0.02%)than it did with blind FT insertion (1.3%-3.2%). Pulmonary-placed FTs may cause harm before clinicians are aware of malplacement. Skilled EMPD operators may avert distal pulmonary FT placement by early identification of pulmonary placement and immediate FT removal. EMPD-assisted FT insertion by a trained and skilled operator may reduce risk for distal pulmonary FT placement and pneumothoraces. Blind FT insertion should be avoided.

RS2 An Evaluation of Early Warning Scores in Predicting Intensive Care Unit Readmission and Hospital Mortality   Heather Cook, Shonda Morrow, Holly Losurdo, Jonathan Shipley, Brittany Wells; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL   Purpose   To identify the best early warning score to assist in identification of patients at risk for readmission to the intensive care (ICU) within 72 hours of transfer and prediction of in-hospital mortality. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and Quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) were the predictor variables in this study.   Background/Significance   Readmission to the ICU is positively correlated with longer hospital stays and increased mortality rates. Early detection and management of patient deterioration is critical to reducing ICU readmission rates and out-of-ICU cardiac arrests. Multiple early warning scores have been developed to aid critical care outreach teams and acute care nurses in early identification of patients whose condition is deteriorating. Little research has been performed comparing these different tools to determine which may be the best indicator.   Method   All adult patients transferred from an ICU to a medical-surgical unit in an urban academic medical center during 3 months were included in the study. Patients with a code status other than “full code” for 72 hours after transfer and those who underwent a surgical procedure during the 72 hours after transfer were excluded. A retrospective chart audit (N = 1181) was used to compile vital signs at time of transfer from ICU and at 12, 24, and 48 hours after transfer (± 4 hours). The NEWS, MEWS, and qSOFA scores were generated for each set of vital signs (N = 4004), and a receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed for each score. The end points identified were ICU readmission within 72 hours and in-hospital mortality.   Result   The NEWS had the highest area under the curve (AUC) among the 3 early warning scores for identifying ICU readmission at each identified time point: acute care arrival (AUC, 0.746; 95% CI, 0.684-0.808), 12 hours after transfer (AUC, 0.829; 95% CI, 0.770-0.889), 24 hours after transfer (AUC, 0.845; 95% CI, 0.777-0.912), and 48 hours after transfer (AUC,0.868; 95% CI, 0.757-0.980). NEWS also had the highest AUC among all 3 early warning scores for identifying mortality at discharge (AUC, 0.868; 95% CI, 0.803-0.931).   Conclusion   NEWS outperformed both MEWS and qSOFA in identifying patients at risk for ICU readmission and in-hospital mortality. NEWS, while not yet commonly used in the United States, may be more sensitive in predicting patients’ outcomes. Improved understanding of the differences between early warning scores and the objective data obtained from this study have garnered physician support and guided the nurse-driven critical care outreach team in recommending and implementing hospital-wide adoption of NEWS.   RS3 Relationship Between Patient Delirium in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and Ventilatory Outcomes   Jessica Zangmeister, Molly McNett, Kathleen Kerber; MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, OH   Purpose   To identify the prevalence of delirium types (hypoactive, hyperactive, mixed) within the first 7 days of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and to determine the relationship between delirium type and ventilatory outcome (unplanned extubation [UE], length of stay, ventilator days).   Background/Significance   Patient delirium is common in ICUs and leads to extended hospital stays and complications. Delirium is categorized as hypoactive, hyperactive, or mixed. Agitation often accompanies hyperactive delirium and is predictive of UE. However, little has been published on the incidence of hypoactive delirium, which does not include agitation, and its relationship to ventilatory outcomes, specifically UE and ventilator days.   Method   The study used a retrospective cohort study design. Consecutive adult patients admitted to a medical ICU within an urban academic public health system during 12 months were enrolled. Data were abstracted on patients’ demographic variables, daily clinical variables (morning and evening delirium, coma, and sedation scores), and outcome variables (length of stay, number of ventilator days, and incidence of UE). Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate regression analyses were performed.   Result   Hypoactive delirium was present from day 3 to day 7 in 44% of patients. Of 25 instances of UE, 20% occurred on day 1, before the development of delirium. Of the remaining cases of UE, up to 74% of patients had hypoactive delirium. The presence of UE resulted in longer stays and more ventilator days (P  0.8) when the detection horizon is 10 minutes before the actual event.   Conclusion   Electronic monitoring data can be used to detect OIRD in patients recovering from anesthesia. Nurses should be provided the most sensitive and specific monitoring devices (capnography and/or minute ventilation) and should be educated on using electronic monitoring data to inform safe monitoring practices once the patient is transferred to the general care unit. Minute ventilation and pulse oximetry are more comfortable for the patient than capnography.

RS13 Compassion Satisfaction and Burnout Among Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Nurses in Relation to Patients’ Deaths   Kyle Richardson, Meredith MacKenzie Greenle; Villanova University, Villanova, PA   Purpose   To examine the impact of resuscitation events, rapid responses, and patients’ deaths on compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary trauma experienced by pediatric critical care nurses. A secondary goal was to examine nurse characteristics associated with compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary trauma.   Background/Significance   The death of a patient can be devastating for a nurse and for the entire nursing unit. The intensity of the grief may be heightened when the patient is a child. Repeated exposure to patient death and near-death experiences (resuscitation events, rapid responses) can create professional and personal stress that could lead to low compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary trauma.   Method   This was a descriptive, comparative study. A JotForm survey was distributed via email and LinkedIn groups to pediatric and neonatal intensive care nurses. A $5 gift card was offered as an incentive for completion. The survey contained demographic questions; a question about codes, rapid responses, and patients’ deaths in the past month; and the Professional Quality of Life Scale, which has 3 subscales measuring compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary trauma. Multivariate linear regression modeling was used to identify correlates of compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary trauma.   Result   Of the 65 respondents, the majority (94%) were female, were age 41 to 45, and had a bachelor’s degree (71%). Patients’ death and near-death experiences were not significantly correlated with nurses’ compassion satisfaction, burnout, or secondary trauma. Higher educational attainment was significantly correlated with lower compassion satisfaction (P = .01). Similarly, a higher educational degree was correlated with higher burnout (P = .005). Last, significant correlates of secondary trauma included age (P = .005), burnout (P = .001), and compassion satisfaction (P = .05); greater age, higher burnout scores, and lower compassion satisfaction were linked to greater secondary trauma.   Conclusion   Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no relationship between patients’ deaths or near-death experiences and nurses’ outcomes. Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of educational attainment on nurses’ outcomes. In addition, examination of possible differences between adult and pediatric intensive care nurses in relationship to compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary trauma is needed.   RS14 Comparison of Oral and Axillary Temperatures in Endotracheally Intubated Pediatric Patients   Danielle Wood; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL   Purpose   In a pediatric intensive care unit in a Midwestern medical center, it was questioned whether oral temperatures are inaccurate in intu-bated patients as a result of heated gases passing through the patients’ airways. Practice within the studied unit was to obtain axillary temperatures, but research shows that this method has greater variability than other forms of measurement. Staff within the unit wanted to know if oral temperatures could be a more reliable form of temperature measurement in the intubated population.   Background/Significance   Published reports about adult intensive care unit populations show that oral temperature in intubated patients was not significantly affected by heated gases passing from the ventilator through the airway. This study aimed to determine if the same is true in pediatric patients.   Method   Patient age groups were delineated into neonate ( 1 year to  4 had their chart reviewed by the RRN to assess the need for a proactive round. Nurses in general care areas were given a phone number to call if they had concerns about a patient but did not want to trigger the RRS.   Result   RRNs reviewed 4000 charts, made 1700 proactive rounds, responded to 400 RRS activations, facilitated 300 ICU transfers, intubated 46 patients, and participated in 36 non-ICU CPAs. Cardiopulmonary arrests outside of the ICU decreased from 10.5 to 2.7 per 1000 discharges (74% decrease), and inside of the ICU they decreased from 7.8 to 5.0 per 1000 discharges (36% decrease). The risk-adjusted mortality index decreased from 0.85 to 0.77. Peer-group ranking improved on the Hospital Survey of Patient Safety, which suggests a positive cultural shift in perception of patient safety. Postintervention survey data showed that 77% of staff thought that proactive rounding by the RRN supported staff and patients.   Conclusion   Implementation of a proactive expert critical care nurse rounding program that leverages technology to identify high-risk patients and allows penetration of critical care expertise outside of the ICU can decrease CPAs outside of the ICU and can increase support to frontline staff.   RS20 Descriptive Analysis of Intensive Care Unit Patients Who Transition to Comfort-Focused Care   Sharon O’Donoghue, Ann Anderson, Noah Tocci, Ashley O'Donoghue; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA   Purpose   The Institutes of Medicine has established comfort-focused care (CFC) as a national safety goal, because approximately one-fifth of Americans die during or shortly after an intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Care at the end of life should be patient-centered; however, many patients in the ICU are not able to make their decisions known because of the severity of their illness. The purpose of this research was to describe characteristics of acutely ill ICU patients who transitioned to CFC.   Background/Significance   Many adults have given little or no thought to their end-of-life wishes and thus have not captured their desires in writing or through conversation with family members. Additionally, ICU patients are generally extremely ill and often unable to articulate their goals of care. Improving our collective understanding of ICU patients who transition to CFC may assist critical care clinicians in better aligning interventions with patients’ goals of care.   Method   A descriptive, retrospective secondary analysis was conducted in 2 medical ICUs at a single institution in Boston. All patients admitted in a 4-month period were included, and those who transitioned to CFC were compared with those who chose to be full code. Demographic data consisted of gender, race, age, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and length of stay. Pain scores and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) were investigated to compare pain and alertness levels.   Result   Of the 196 patients, 20.4% (40) were made CFC and 79.6% (156) were designated as full code. Of those who transitioned to CFC, 38% (15) were female, whereas the full-code group consisted of 49% (77) females. The mean age for the CFC group was 66.7 years, and the mean age of the full-code group was 60.7 (P = .03). Length of stay in the ICU was much longer in the CFC group: 8.3 days vs 4.6 days (P  24 hours and defines early extubation as occurring within 6 hours of surgery. Early extubation is associated with fewer adverse outcomes, shorter stays in the hospital and intensive care unit, and lower costs. Longer ventilation times are associated with higher health costs and increased risk of pulmonary complications. Standardized weaning protocols effectively reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation.   Method   We used a pre-post improvement science approach to evaluate the use of an evidence-based fast-track extubation (FTE) protocol in stable postoperative cardiac surgery patients. Intubation time and barriers to extubation were tracked in a baseline cohort (cohort 1; n = 101) in one quarter of 2016. An interdisciplinary team developed a nurse-driven FTE protocol designed to provide guidance for patient progression and address barriers identified in the baseline cohort. We monitored postimplementation data the same quarter after implementing the protocol (cohort 2; n = 211). A data form was designed and institutional review board approval for exemption was obtained. Data collection was done in Excel and analysis was done in SPSS.   Result   There was no statistical difference in demographic characteristics by cohort. The mean age was 61 (SD, 13.7) years, and a majority of the patients were male (n = 209; 67%) and white (n = 253; 81%). Cases were similar for both groups: 266 elective (85%), 46 urgent (15%), and 0 emergent. In cohort 1, 48.5% (49 of 101) of patients were extubated in  18 years of age within 24 hours of intubation and randomized the patients into groups. Every 4 hours, we performed oral care and deep oral suctioning with a catheter in NO-ASPIRATE patients and performed usual oral care in control patients. We collected oral and tracheal specimens for amylase at baseline and every 12 hours. Analysis for pepsin was added during the study. We recorded demographic and outcome data including VAC, ventilator hours, and ICU/hospital LOS. Patients who were enrolled for at least 36 hours (n = 410) were included in the analysis: 206 patients in the NO-ASPIRATE group and 204 patients in the control group. Data were analyzed with the χ2 test, the t test, and the general estimating equation.   Result   Demographic data were comparable between groups (P > .05). Patients’ characteristics were as follows: mean age, 58.6 years; 59% male; 26% racial minority; mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, 23. Although values were lower in the NO-ASPIRATE group, no significant differences were found between groups for mean level of tracheal amylase (15 462 vs 13 251 U/L; P = .49), mean level of tracheal pepsin (5 vs 4 U/L; P = .55), ventilator time (159 vs 147 hours; P = .21), or ICU LOS (10.8 vs 9.8 days; P = .16). VAC rate and time to VAC were similar between groups (P = .86). The general estimating equation subanalysis showed that the NO-ASPIRATE treatment was superior to the control treatment in patients with a baseline amylase level of 1500 to 5000 U/L. Also, patients in the NO-ASPIRATE group had 4 fewer days in the hospital (23 vs 19 days; P = .05).   Conclusion   The NO-ASPIRATE group had a shorter hospital LOS, and a subgroup had reduced aspiration of oral secretions. Although not statistically significant, shorter ventilator hours and ICU LOS for the NO-ASPIRATE group are clinically significant outcomes. The lack of statistical significance may be the result of standard oral care delivered by the study team every 4 hours and a small effect size for some outcome measures. Oral care, including oral suction, remains an important nursing intervention.   Disclosure   NIH Funding 1R01NR0145.   RS25 Transitioning Into Critical Care With Interprofessional Education   Kelly Rossler, Katherine Hardin, Jennifer Taylor; Louise Herrington School of Nursing, Baylor University, Dallas, TX   Purpose   To compare the effectiveness of simulation-based interprofessional education with the effectiveness of online interprofessional education in promoting interprofessional socialization and collaboration of newly licensed registered nurses transitioning into critical care practice. This proposal addressed research priorities focused on optimizing the contribution of the critical care nurse and defining best methods for interactional team-based learning.   Background/Significance   It is vital for newly licensed registered nurses to enter critical care practice with exposure to the interprofessional collaboration core competencies of values, role responsibilities, communication, and teamwork skills. Unfortunately, many nurse internship programs emphasize unit-specific education and demonstration of nurse-related skill competencies. This research informs transition into practice by identifying effective interprofessional teaching strategies.   Method   A convergent, parallel, mixed-methods design addressed the research questions. A convenience sample consisted of new nurses (N = 57) accepted into a critical care internship and randomized into either a control group (interprofessional online module) or an experimental group (interprofessional simulation-based education). The American Association of Critical-Care Nurses Synergy Model for Patient Care provided theoretical context. An experimental pretest-posttest design examined group differences and change over time. The Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale (ISVS) and the Interprofessional Collaborative Competency Attainment Survey (ICCAS) were analyzed with SPSS. Hermeneutic phenomenology was used for qualitative data collection and analysis.   Result   Wilcoxon signed rank test results revealed statistically significant changes in interprofessional attributes of values/socialization and competency attainment from pretest to posttest scores in both the control group (z = −3.447, P < .001) and the experimental group (z = −3.91, P < .001). The Mann-Whitney U test results revealed no significant differences in these interprofessional attributes, with U = 295.5, z = −0.54, P = .59 for the ISVS and U = 264, z = 1.14, P = .26 for the ICCAS. Qualitative themes emerged as humanizing communication and feeling safe with interprofessional rounding. Quantitative and qualitative data merged within interprofessional socialization, values, and collaboration.   Conclusion   Online modules and simulation-based interprofessional teaching methods provided a means for newly licensed registered nurses to gain exposure to and learn about interprofessional core competencies. Participants verbalized how learning their role prepared them to become effective interprofessional team members. Findings inform best practice initiatives centered on identifying effective teaching strategies for new critical care nurses to develop an interprofessional collaborative practice.   RS26 Effects of a Phase II Cardiac Rehabilitation Program on Patients’ Depression   Michael LeGal; Banner Health System, Phoenix, AZ   Purpose   To describe how many patients who have come through a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program after a cardiac event self-identified as depressed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) tool and to determine the severity of the depression. Differences in levels of depression of patients were evaluated before and after the CR program and were assessed by procedure, gender, and age.   Background/Significance   Screening for depression upon intake and completion of a phase II CR program may influence the type of interventions implemented by CR staff and reduce depression. We examined patients before and after a phase II CR program who self-reported as depressed via the CES-D score and we also assessed scores by procedure, gender, and age. We further identified the types of interventions used for those who were depressed.   Method   We conducted a pre-post intervention study. Using a convenience sample, we collected data on CES-D scores before and after the program and by type of procedure, gender, and age from May 1, 2013, to April 30, 2017. We conducted independent and paired t test and analyses of variance.   Result   Among 132 patients, 25 (19%) self-reported as depressed and most who were depressed had at least 1 intervention (n = 22, 88%). For the total group, patients had significantly lower CES-D scores at the end of the CR program (mean [SD], 6.87 [6.64]) than they did before they started the program (8.79 [8.09], t = 0.53; P = .003). For only depressed patients, CES-D scores were also lower at the end than they were at the start of the program (P < .001). No differences were found in level of depression based on type of procedure, gender, or age.   Conclusion   Interventions used by CR staff were effective in decreasing depression scores from intake to completion of a phase II program. Our results and recommendations were reviewed and discussed with the stakeholders to improve and standardize depression interventions.   RS27 Audible Pause Alarms During End-of-Life Care: Implications for Alarm Fatigue   Sukardi Suba, Michele Pelter, Xiao Hu; University of California, San Francisco, CA   Purpose   To describe electrocardiographic (ECG) arrhythmia alarm frequencies following a decision for end-of-life care.   Background/Significance   Studies show that a high number of alarms, of which the vast majority are false or nonactionable, is associated with alarm fatigue. Continuous ECG monitoring is generally not recommended at the end of life. Few studies have described how often audible ECG alarms occur after the initiation of comfort care. This issue is important because unnecessary monitoring alarms during end-of-life create noise for patients and families and can significantly contribute to alarm fatigue.   Method   This was a secondary analysis from an alarm study conducted at a tertiary academic medical center. In the primary study, the investigators collected data on all physiological alarms from the bedside monitors in 461 intensive care unit patients during a 31-day study period. For the present study, we conducted chart reviews in all patients who died during the study period and determined which patients had pause rhythm alarms and transitioned to comfort care. We then determined the frequency of pause alarms after the initiation of comfort care and the alarm audio level. We specifically focused on pause alarms because our preliminary data showed that pause alarms commonly occurred among patients with comfort care.   Result   Of 461 patients, 42 patients (9%) died during the study period. Out of those 42 patients, 10 patients (24%) had transitioned to comfort care because of various diagnoses (eg, liver failure, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, cholangiocellular and hepatocellular carcinoma, non–small cell lung cancer, and hemorrhagic stroke). These 10 patients had a total of 116 pause alarms, 87 (75%) of which occurred after initiation of comfort care. Of the 87 alarms, 48 alarms (55%) were audible, 29 alarms (33%) were manually muted, and 10 alarms (12%) were of unknown audio level. All pause alarms were set at a warning level, which means the bedside monitor will sound 2 beeps.   Conclusion   In 10 patients on comfort care, 50% of pause alarms remained audible. The 29 muted alarms indicated that nurses had spent unnecessary time to silence the monitor. Nurses who are unaware that the patient is on comfort care also may mistakenly treat these alarms and cause undue distress (ie, administer medication, pacer, call code blue). Since these arrhythmia alarms are unnecessary, changing the alarm setting into inaudible could reduce alarm noise and could alleviate alarm fatigue.

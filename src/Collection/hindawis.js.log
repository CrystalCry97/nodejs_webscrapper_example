In the present research, we aimed to explore the effect of KCNQ1OT1 on osteosarcoma and further explore the special molecular mechanism. The expression of KCNQ1OT1 was analyzed in tumor and adjacent tissues of 30 patients with osteosarcoma by RT-PCR. Cell proliferation and invasion were explored using MTT and transwell assay, respectively. Luciferase reporter analysis and pull-down assay were performed to determine the binding activity of KCNQ1OT1 and miR-129-5p. The result revealed that KCNQ1OT1 was highly expressed in osteosarcoma tissues and cells. KCNQ1OT1-siRNA inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance of osteosarcoma cells. The luciferase reporter assay and pull-down assay demonstrated that KCNQ1OT1 directly interact with miR-129-5p. In addition, miR-129-5p binds to LARP1 directly, and LARP1 promoted the proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance of osteosarcoma cells. What is more, KCNQ1OT1 promoted proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance via inhibiting the expression of miR-129-5p and further promoting the expression of miR-129-5p-mediated LARP1. Collectively, it suggests that downregulation of KCNQ1OT1 inhibits proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance by regulating miR-129-5p-mediated LARP1 in osteosarcoma cells.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/7698767/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:01.454Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:01.454Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5510a5b8a8044a17bc5e0c","title":"Simulating Notch-Dome Morphology of Action Potential of Ventricular Cell: How the Speeds of Positive and Negative Feedbacks on Transmembrane Voltage Can Influence the Health of a Cell?","abstract":"Ventricular action potential is well-known because of its plateau phase with a spike-notch-dome morphology. As such, the morphology of action potential is necessary for ensuring a correct heart functioning. Any distraction from normal notch-dome morphology may trigger a circus movement reentry in the form of lethal ventricular fibrillation. When the epicardial action potential dome propagates from a site where it is maintained to regions where it has been lost, it gives rise to the proposed mechanism for the Brugada syndrome. Despite the impact of notch-dome dynamics on the heart function, no independent and explicit research has been performed on the simulation of notch-dome dynamics and morphology. In this paper, using a novel mathematical approach, a three-state variable model is proposed; we show that our proposed model not only can simulate morphology of action potential of ventricular cells but also can propose a biological reasonable tool for controlling of the morphology of action potential spike-notch-dome. We show that the processes of activation and inactivation of ionic gating variables (as positive or negative feedbacks on the voltage of cell membrane) and the ratio of their speeds (time constants) can be treated as a reasonable biological tool for simulating ventricular cell notch-dome. This finding may led to a new insight to the quantification of the health of a ventricular cell and may also propose a new drug therapy strategy for cardiac diseases.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/5169241/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:01.455Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:01.455Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5510a5b8a8044a17bc5e0d","title":"Physiologically Difficult Airway in the Patient with Severe Hypotension and Metabolic Acidosis","abstract":"The expertise to recognize and manage the difficult airway is essential in anesthesiology. Conventionally, this refers to anatomical concerns causing difficulties with facemask ventilation and/or with tracheal intubation. Severe derangements in patients&#x2019; physiology can make induction and intubation likewise difficult, and approximately 30&#x0025; of critically ill patients had cardiovascular collapse subsequently to intubation. We present the case of a 58-year-old male with a past medical history of type II diabetes and hypertension who presented with altered mental status due to severe metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.8 on admission to the intensive care unit. The anesthesia team was called to urgently intubate the patient. Upon arrival, the patient was localizing to pain and was hypocapnic, tachycardic, and hypotensive despite ongoing therapy with norepinephrine, vasopressin, and bicarbonate drips. Bedside point-of-care ultrasound showed hyperdynamic left ventricle with no other abnormalities. The patient was induced with IV ketamine, and dissociation occurred with maintenance of spontaneous respirations, which was followed by laryngoscopy and intubation causing only minimal hemodynamic changes. The patient was subsequently dialyzed and treated supportively. He was discharged from the hospital two weeks later&#x2014;neurologically intact and at his baseline. Combination of hypotension and severe metabolic acidosis is particularly a challenging setting for airway management and a major risk factor for adverse events, including cardiopulmonary arrest. Hemodynamically stable induction agents should be preferred. In addition, sustaining spontaneous ventilation and avoiding periods of apnea in the peri-intubation period is paramount&#x2014;any buildup of CO<sub>2</sub> could push a critically low pH even lower and cause cardiovascular collapse. Sympathomimetic properties of ketamine make this induction agent a particularly appealing choice in this setting. This case report further supports the concept that severe physiologic perturbations&#x2014;in which conventional induction techniques are not feasible&#x2014;should be included in the current definition of a difficult airway.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cria/2020/8821827/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:01.455Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:01.455Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5510a5b8a8044a17bc5e0e","title":"Bibliometric Analysis of Ebola Research Indexed in Web of Science and Scopus (2010-2020)","abstract":"<i>Background</i>. Within the past decade, Africa has faced several recurrent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD), including the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa and the recent 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The study thus aimed at quantifying and mapping the scientific output of EVD research published within 2010-2020 though a bibliometric perspective. <i>Methods</i>. EVD-related publications from 2010 to 2020 were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases by using the keywords &#x2018;Ebola&#x2019;, &#x2018;Ebola Virus Disease&#x2019;, &#x2018;Ebolas&#x2019;, and &#x2018;ebolavirus&#x2019;. Biblioshiny software (using R-studio cloud) was used to categorise and evaluate authors&#x2019;, countries&#x2019; and journals&#x2019; contribution. VOSviewer was used for network visualisation. <i>Results</i>. According to the used search strategy, a total of 3865 and 3848 EVD documents were published in WoS and Scopus, respectively. The average citation per document was 16.1 (WoS) and 16.3 (Scopus). The results show an overall increase in the publication trend within the study period. The leading countries in EVD research were the USA and UK, with over 100 papers in both databases, including Nigeria and South Africa. NIAID and CDC-USA were the most influential institutions, while &#x201C;Infectious Diseases&#x201D; and &#x201C;Medicine&#x201D; were the most decisive research fields. The most contributing authors included Feldmann H and Qiu XG with over 60 papers in each database, while <i>Journal of Infectious Diseases</i> was the most crucial journal. The most cited article was from Aylward et al. published in 2014, while recent years displayed a keyword focus on &#x201C;double-blind&#x201D;, &#x201C;efficacy&#x201D;, &#x201C;ring vaccination&#x201D; and &#x201C;drug effect&#x201D;. <i>Conclusion</i>. This bibliometric analysis provides an updated historical perspective of progress in EVD research and has highlighted the role played by various stakeholders.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of ceRNAs in breast cancer (BC) and construct a new five-mRNA prognostic signature. <i>Methods</i>. The ceRNA network was constructed by different RNAs screened by the edgeR package. The BC prognostic signature was built based on the Cox regression analysis. The log-rank method was used to analyse the survival rate of BC patients with different risk scores. The expression of the 5 genes was verified by the GSE81540 dataset and CPTAC database. <i>Results</i>. A total of 41 BC-adjacent tissues and 473 BC tissues were included in this study. A total of 2,966 differentially expressed lncRNAs, 5,370 differentially expressed mRNAs, and 359 differentially expressed miRNAs were screened. The ceRNA network was constructed using 13 lncRNAs, 267 mRNAs, and 35 miRNAs. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) methods showed that two lncRNAs (AC037487.1 and MIR22HG) are related to prognosis. Five mRNAs (<i>VPS28</i>, <i>COL17A1</i>, <i>HSF1</i>, <i>PUF60</i>, and <i>SMOC1</i>) in the ceRNA network were used to establish a prognostic signature.

Next, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and overall survival (OS) analysis of hub targets was performed using the Kaplan&#x2013;Meier Plotter online tool. Finally, the mechanism was further analyzed via molecular docking of quercetin with the hub targets. Thirty-six quercetin-related genes were identified, 15 of which overlapped with GC-related targets. These targets were further mapped to 319 GO biological process terms and 10 remarkable pathways. In the PPI network analysis, six hub targets were identified, including AKT1, EGFR, SRC, IGF1R, PTK2, and KDR. The high expression of these targets was related to poor OS in GC patients.

In this study, a NEC rat model was established using Sprague-Dawley rat pups. Small RNA sequencing was used to analyze the miRNA expression profiles in the NEC and control rats. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were carried out to identify target mRNAs for the DE miRNAs and to explore their potential roles. The DE miRNAs were verified by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The status of intestinal injury and the elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in the NEC group confirmed that the NEC model was successfully established. The 16 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between the NEC group and the control group of rats. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the parental genes of the DE miRNAs were predominantly implicated in the phosphorylation, cell migration, and protein phosphorylation processes. Moreover, the DE miRNAs were mainly found to be involved in the pathways of axon guidance, endocytosis, and focal adhesion, as well as in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is related to colitis. The expression patterns of the candidate miRNAs (rno-miR-27a-5p and rno-miR-187-3p), as assessed by RT-qPCR, were in accordance with the expression patterns obtained by miRNA-sequencing. The miRNA/mRNA/pathway network revealed that rno-miR-27a-5p and rno-miR-187-3p might be involved in NEC via the Wnt signaling pathway. We found an altered miRNA expression pattern in rats with NEC. We hypothesize that rno-miR-27a-5p and rno-miR-187-3p might mediate the NEC pathophysiological processes via the Wnt signaling pathway.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/5150869/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:01.455Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:01.455Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5510a5b8a8044a17bc5e13","title":"Comparative Study of Leaf and Rootstock Aqueous Extracts of Foeniculum vulgare on Chemical Profile and In Vitro Antioxidant and Antihyperglycemic Activities","abstract":"<i>Foeniculum vulgare</i> is a medicinal plant used in Moroccan folk medicine to treat several diseases such as diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the phenolic bioactive compounds and to evaluate the antioxidant and antihyperglycemic activities of <i>Foeniculum vulgare</i> leaf and rootstock extracts. Phenolic compounds of <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock and leaf extracts were determined using HPLC-DAD-QTOFMS analysis. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2&#x2019;-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS<sup>&#x2022;&#x2b;</sup>) radicals. Moreover, the <i>in vitro</i> antihyperglycemic effects were tested by measuring the inhibition of <i>&#x3b1;</i>-amylase and <i>&#x3b1;</i>-glucosidase activities. HPLC-DAD-QTOFMS analysis identified thirty-two phenolic components in both leaf and rootstock extracts. Caffeic acid, quinic acid, and chlorogenic acid were the major compounds of <i>F. vulgare</i> leaf extract (FVLE), while the main compound of <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock extracts (FVRE) was quinic acid. In the DPPH assay, <i>F. vulgare</i> leaf extract showed important antioxidant activity (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;12.16&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.02&#x2009;<i>&#x3bc;</i>g/mL) than <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock extract (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;34.36&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.09&#x2009;<i>&#x3bc;</i>g/mL). Moreover, fennel leaf extracts revealed also the most powerful antioxidant activity (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;22.95&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.4&#x2009;<i>&#x3bc;</i>g/mL) in the ABTS assay. The <i>in vitro</i> antihyperglycemic activity showed that <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock extract exhibited a remarkable inhibitory capacity (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;194.30&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.8&#x2009;<i>&#x3bc;</i>g/mL) of <i>&#x3b1;</i>-amylase compared with <i>F. vulgare</i> leaf extract (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;1026.50&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.5&#x2009;<i>&#x3bc;</i>g/mL). Furthermore, the inhibition of <i>&#x3b1;</i>-glucosidase was more importantly with <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock (IC<sub>50</sub> of 165.90&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.2&#x2009;<i>&#x3bc;</i>g/mL) than <i>F. vulgare</i> leaf extracts (203.80&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.3&#x2009;<i>&#x3bc;</i>g/mL). The funding of this study showed that <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock and leaf extracts presented several phenolic compounds and showed important antioxidant and antidiabetic effects. We suggest that the identified molecules are responsible for the obtained activities. However, further studies focusing on the isolation and the determination of antioxidant and antidiabetic effects of <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock and leaf main compounds are required.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aps/2020/8852570/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:01.455Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:01.455Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5510a5b8a8044a17bc5e12","title":"Symphysis-Fundal Height Curve in Pregnancies Complicated by Maternal Hyperglycemia: Comparison with Curves of Nondiabetic Pregnant Women","abstract":"<i>Background</i>.

Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of the training group, validation group, and overall samples proved that the model had statistical significance in predicting the outcomes of patients. Independent prognosis analysis suggested that this risk score might serve as an independent prognosis factor for CRC patients. Moreover, we combined the prognostic model and the clinical characteristics in a nomogram to predict the overall survival of CRC patients. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to identify the enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways in the high- and low-risk groups, which might provide novel therapeutic targets for CRC patients. We discovered through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and TF-MRG regulatory network that 7 hub genes were retrieved from the PPI network and 4 kinds of differentially expressed TFs (NR3C1, MYH11, MAF, and CBX7) positively regulated 4 prognosis-associated MRGs (GSTM5, PTGIS, ENPP2, and P4HA3).","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/5974350/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:01.455Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:01.455Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5510c2b8a8044a17bc5e18","title":"Effect of Pingchuan Formula on Toll-Like Receptors and Dendritic Cells in an Asthmatic Mouse Model","abstract":"Pingchuan formula (PCF) was created by Professor Yu Jianer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of PCF on dendritic cells (DCs) and toll-like receptors (TLRs) in initiating immunity. A bronchial asthma BALB/c mouse model was established using an OVA excitation method. PCF was immediately administered by gavage after the first excitation. After 7&#x2009;d, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the pathological changes in the asthma model. Eosinophil infiltration and concentrations of IL-4, IFN-r, IL-12, and IFN-<i>&#x03B1;</i> in BALF were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Real-time PCR was used to determine mRNA levels of IL-12 and IFN-<i>&#x03B1;</i>. Protein expression levels of ERK, Toll-2, IDO, and Toll-9 were measured by immunoblot. HE and ELISA showed that PCF could improve lung pathological changes and significantly decrease the concentration of IL-4 in BALF. Moreover, PCF could increase IL-12, IFN-<i>&#x03B1;</i>, and IFN-r in BALF. Real-time PCR and western blot showed that PCF restored the DCs and TLRs in initiating immunity. In summary, this study found that PCF can improve the pathological changes and reduce the symptoms of asthma in a BALB/c mouse model.

Irisin, a muscle factor, plays an important role in metabolic disorders. However, the role of irisin in AKI is still unclear. To assess the effect of irisin on the course of AKI, we used an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) C57BL/6 mouse model. Supplementation with irisin attenuated kidney injury induced by I/R, as shown by decreases in the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Animal model studies also showed that irisin pretreatment upregulates the expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and protects against the renal cell apoptosis and oxidative stress caused by I/R. <i>In vitro</i>, hypoxia/recovery (H/R) treatment was applied to induce tubular cell apoptosis. Irisin pretreatment ameliorated the cell apoptosis induced by H/R, while transfection of UCP2 siRNA significantly reduced the protective effect of irisin in cells after H/R. In addition, AMPK signaling may be involved in irisin-mediated upregulation of UCP2 in a renal proximal tubular epithelial cell (PTEC) model. Thus, the renoprotective effect of irisin on AKI may be mediated through increasing the expression of UCP2 in kidneys after I/R.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6537371/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:30.496Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:30.496Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5510c2b8a8044a17bc5e17","title":"Hepatoprotective Activity of Leptadenia hastata (Asclepiadaceae) on Acetaminophen-Induced Toxicity in Mice: In Vivo Study and Characterization of Bioactive Compounds through Molecular Docking Approaches","abstract":"<i>Background and Objectives</i>. <i>Leptadenia hastata</i> is a liana from the family of Asclepiadaceae used in tropical Africa to treat diabetes mellitus.

The present study was to develop a new prognostic signature by integrating long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and evaluate its prognostic performance. <i>Methods</i>. The RNA expression data of PCa patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE17951, GSE7076, and GSE16560). The PCa-driven modules were identified by constructing a weighted gene coexpression network, the corresponding genes of which were overlapped with differentially expressed RNAs (DERs) screened by the MetaDE package. The optimal prognostic signature was screened using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis. The prognostic performance and functions of the combined prognostic signature was then assessed. <i>Results</i>. Twelve PCa-driven modules were identified using TCGA dataset and validated in the GSE17951 and GSE7076 datasets, and six of them were considered to be preserved. A total of 217 genes in these 6 modules were overlapped with 699 DERs, from which a nine-gene prognostic signature was identified (including 3 lncRNAs and 6 mRNAs), and the risk score of each patient was calculated. The overall survival was significantly shortened in patients having the risk score higher than the cut-off, which was demonstrated in TCGA (<span class=\"inline_break\"><svg

The white blood cell count to mean platelet volume ratio (WMR) is an indicator of inflammation in patients with atherosclerotic disease. Residual SYNTAX Score (RSS) is an objective measure of degree and complexity of residual stenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We investigated the relationship between WMR and clinical prognosis and RSS in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (P-PCI). <i>Method</i>. Between June 2015 and December 2018, 537 patients who underwent primary PCI were evaluated for in-hospital events, and 477 patients were evaluated for clinical events during follow-up after discharge. The endpoint of our study is major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) seen in the in-hospital and follow-up periods. <i>Results</i>. In our study, 537 patients were stratified into two groups according to admission median WMR.

To investigate the efficacy of drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatment for de novo coronary artery lesions in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). <i>Background</i>. DCB was an effective therapy for patients with in-stent restenosis. However, the efficacy of DCB in patients with de novo coronary artery lesions is still unknown. <i>Methods</i>. Eligible studies were searched on PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library Database. Systematic review and meta-analyses of RCTs were performed comparing DCB with non-DCB devices (such as plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA), bare-metal stents (BMS), or drug-eluting stents (DES)) for the treatment of de novo lesions. Trial sequential meta-analysis (TSA) was performed to assess the false positive and false negative errors. <i>Results</i>. A total of 2,137 patients enrolled in 12 RCTs were analyzed. Overall, no significant difference in target lesion revascularization (TLR) was found, but there were numerically lower rates after DCB treatment at 6 to 12 months follow-up (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.01; <span class=\"inline_break\"><svg xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"19.289pt\" style=\"vertical-align:-0.2064009pt\" id=\"M1\" height=\"8.8423pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"-0.0498162 -8.6359 19.289 8.8423\"><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,0,0)\"><path id=\"g113-81\" d=\"M600 480C600 590 528 650 384 650H143L137 622C222 614 225 607 210 531L130 127C113 41 106 36 23 28L17 0H294L300 28C204 36 195 42 212 127L243 284L314 263C327 263 339 263 352 264C465 271 600 337 600 480ZM508 481C508 351 402 304 329 304C289 304 265 311 250 317L295 559C302 594 310 606 323 611C335 616 350 619 367 619C455 619 508 573 508 481Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,11.658,0)\"><path id=\"g117-34\" d=\"M535 323V373H52V323H535ZM535 138V188H52V138H535Z\"/></g></svg><span class=\"irelop\"/><span class=\"nowrap\"><svg xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"21.918pt\" style=\"vertical-align:-0.2064009pt\" height=\"8.8423pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"22.8711838 -8.6359 21.918 8.8423\"><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,22.921,0)\"><path id=\"g113-49\" d=\"M241 635C89 635 35 457 35 312C35 153 89 -12 240 -12C390 -12 443 166 443 312C443 466 390 635 241 635ZM238 602C329 602 354 454 354 312C354 172 330 22 240 22C152 22 124 173 124 313S148 602 238 602Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,29.161,0)\"><path id=\"g113-47\" d=\"M113 -12C146 -12 170 11 170 46C170 78 146 103 114 103S58 78 58 46C58 11 82 -12 113 -12Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,32.125,0)\"><use xlink:href=\"#g113-49\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,38.365,0)\"><path id=\"g113-55\" d=\"M137 343C167 482 260 545 321 574C357 591 397 603 429 609L423 641C382 634 335 622 295 608C189 570 37 457 37 238C37 84 125 -12 242 -12C362 -12 447 89 447 209C447 311 374 393 267 393C247 393 226 386 204 376L137 343ZM227 337C318 337 361 256 361 173C361 105 336 22 258 22C176 22 126 120 126 240C126 266 127 291 132 310C155 323 189 337 227 337Z\"/></g></svg>;</span></span> TSA-adjusted CI: 0.41 to 1.16).

Differences in regions, educated parents, born in singleton, public sector delivery, nonavailability of occupation of parents, mothers older than 16 at first birth, breastfeeding, use of a contraceptive method, child vaccination, higher number of family size, repeated antenatal visits, and preceding birth interval play a significant role regarding the survival of under-five children. These, among other differences, should be addressed decisively as part of any upcoming strategic interventions to improve the survival of children in line with the target of 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aph/2020/8430246/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:30.496Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:39:30.496Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5510c2b8a8044a17bc5e1b","title":"The Predictive Value of Serum Uric Acid on Acute Kidney Injury following Traumatic Brain Injury","abstract":"<i>Backgrounds</i>. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent nonneurological complication in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We designed this study to explore the association between serum uric acid (SUA) level and the occurrence of AKI following TBI. <i>Methods</i>. This is a retrospective single-center study. A total of 479 patients admitted with TBI were included in this study. We utilized SUA and other risk factors for AKI to construct a predictive model by performing multivariate logistic regression. 374 patients and 105 patients were, respectively, divided into a training set and validation set. The predictive value of the single SUA and constructed model was evaluated by drawing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. AKI was diagnosed according to the KIDGO criteria. <i>Results</i>. 79 (21.12%) patients were diagnosed with AKI in the training cohort.

This study focused on comprehensive identification, validation, and functional annotations of prognostic differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between melanocytic nevus and malignant melanoma in genome-wide profiles. DEGs were obtained using three chip datasets from GEO database to identify after standardization annotation. A total of 73 DEGs were identified as possible candidate prognostic biomarkers between melanocytic nevus and malignant melanoma. In addition, survival curves indicated that six hub genes, including <i>FABP5</i>, <i>IVL</i>, <i>KRT6A</i>, <i>KRT15</i>, <i>KRT16</i>, and <i>TIMP2</i>, were significant prognostic signatures for CM and of significant value to predict transformation from nevi to melanoma. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry staining was performed to validate differential expression levels and prognostic implications of six hub genes between CM tissue and nevus tissues from the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University cohort. It suggested that significantly elevated <i>FABP5</i>, <i>IVL</i>, <i>KRT6A</i>, <i>KRT15</i>, <i>KRT16</i>, and <i>TIMP2</i> proteins expressed in the CM than in the nevus tissues. Functional enrichment and significant pathways of the six significant hub genes indicated that the mostly involved hallmarks include the <i>P53</i> pathway, <i>K-ras</i> signaling, estrogen response late, and estrogen response early. In summary, this study identified significant DEGs participating in the process of malignant transformation from nevus to melanoma tissues based on comprehensive genomic profiles. Transcription profiles of <i>FABP5</i>, <i>IVL</i>, <i>KRT6A</i>, <i>KRT15</i>, <i>KRT16</i>, and <i>TIMP2</i> provided clues of prognostic implications, which might help us evaluate malignant potential of nevus and underlying carcinogenesis progress from melanocytic nevus to melanoma.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/1840415/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:06.388Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:06.388Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55115ea869ea531a5822cd","title":"Efficacy of Sucralfate-Combined Quadruple Therapy on Gastric Mucosal Injury Induced by Helicobacter pylori and Its Effect on Gastrointestinal Flora","abstract":"<i>Background</i>. This study explored the therapeutic efficacy of standard triple therapy combined with sucralfate suspension gel as well as the mechanisms of action in mouse models of <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> infection. <i>Materials and Methods</i>. C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 5 groups: NC (natural control), HP (<i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> infection), RAC (rabeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin), RACS (RAC and sucralfate suspension gel), and RACB (RAC and bismuth potassium citrate).

We aimed to explore the neuroimmune mechanism and identify some new diagnostic or therapeutic targets for NP treatment via bioinformatic analysis. <i>Methods.</i> The microarray GSE18803 was downloaded and analyzed using R. The Venn diagram was drawn to find neuroimmune-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in neuropathic pain. Gene Ontology (GO), pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were used to analyze DEGs, respectively. Besides, the identified hub genes were submitted to the DGIdb database to find relevant therapeutic drugs. <i>Results</i>. A total of 91 neuroimmune-related DEGs were identified. The results of GO and pathway enrichment analyses were closely related to immune and inflammatory responses. PPI analysis showed two important modules and 8 hub genes: <i>PTPRC</i>, <i>CD68</i>, <i>CTSS</i>, <i>RAC2</i>, <i>LAPTM5</i>, <i>FCGR3A</i>, <i>CD53</i>, and <i>HCK</i>. The drug-hub gene interaction network was constructed by Cytoscape, and it included 24 candidate drugs and 3 hub genes. <i>Conclusion</i>. The present study helps us better understand the neuroimmune mechanism of neuropathic pain and provides some novel insights on NP treatment, such as modulation of microglia polarization and targeting bone resorption. Besides, <i>CD68</i>, <i>CTSS</i>, <i>LAPTM5</i>, <i>FCGR3A</i>, and <i>CD53</i> may be used as early diagnostic biomarkers and the gene HCK can be a therapeutic target.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/4516349/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:06.389Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:06.389Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55115ea869ea531a5822ce","title":"Coinfection of High-Risk Human Papillomavirus and Lower Genital Tract Pathogens in the Development of High-Grade Cervical Lesions","abstract":"<i>Purpose</i>.

We found that THAP11 was significantly downregulated in GC tissues and GC cell lines. Functionally, THAP11 overexpression markedly inhibited cell growth, induced G1/G0 cell-cycle arrest, and promoted cell apoptosis of MKN-45 cells, while silencing of THAP11 led to increased cell growth, increased DNA synthesis, and inhibited apoptosis. In addition, THAP11 negatively regulated the expression of c-Myc, decreased cyclinD1 protein, and increased p27 and p21 protein levels. We also found cell growth suppression induced by THAP11 was rescued by c-Myc overexpression, further confirming that THAP11 suppresses gastric cancer cell growth via the c-Myc pathway.

The sleep disorders used 1 : 1 matching, finally providing a sample with 60 cases and 60 controls for measurement of the <i>CLOCK</i> gene (rs1801260, rs6850524), to analyze the effect of the interaction between mental health and the <i>CLOCK</i> gene on sleep. The mental health and sleep quality of the surgical nurses were evaluated using the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The study found that surgical nurses had poor sleep, and there were differences associated with age, years working, frequency of night shifts, and incidence of sleep disorders under marital status (<span class=\"inline_break\"><svg xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"18.973pt\" style=\"vertical-align:-3.42938pt\" id=\"M1\" height=\"11.7782pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"-0.0498162 -8.34882 18.973 11.7782\"><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,0,0)\"><path id=\"g113-113\" d=\"M570 304C570 398 525 448 414 448C385 448 343 445 312 434L329 511L321 518C297 504 262 482 244 460L233 411C195 397 159 381 128 358L135 332C160 347 189 360 224 373L111 -147C97 -210 84 -218 17 -231L13 -257L254 -247L259 -218L233 -216C183 -212 177 -202 189 -142L218 -1C238 -10 266 -12 283 -12C351 3 429 48 483 105C543 168 570 242 570 304ZM482 289C482 161 380 33 304 33C278 33 248 51 233 69L303 396C326 400 352 403 369 403C428 403 482 380 482 289Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,11.342,0)\"><path id=\"g117-91\" d=\"M512 -3V55L134 254V256L512 456V514L75 281V230L512 -3Z\"/></g></svg><span class=\"irelop\"/><span class=\"nowrap\"><svg xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"21.921pt\" style=\"vertical-align:-3.42938pt\" height=\"11.7782pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"22.555183800000002 -8.34882 21.921 11.7782\"><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,22.605,0)\"><path id=\"g113-49\" d=\"M241 635C89 635 35 457 35 312C35 153 89 -12 240 -12C390 -12 443 166 443 312C443 466 390 635 241 635ZM238 602C329 602 354 454 354 312C354 172 330 22 240 22C152 22 124 173 124 313S148 602 238 602Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,28.845,0)\"><path id=\"g113-47\" d=\"M113 -12C146 -12 170 11 170 46C170 78 146 103 114 103S58 78 58 46C58 11 82 -12 113 -12Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,31.809,0)\"><use xlink:href=\"#g113-49\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,38.049,0)\"><path id=\"g113-54\" d=\"M153 550H386L412 615L406 623H120L82 318C104 327 142 338 184 338C294 338 347 275 347 187C347 112 305 39 221 39C160 39 119 71 97 89C88 97 80 96 71 90C59 80 50 67 49 57C48 45 52 36 66 23C80 9 123 -12 169 -12C221 -11 288 15 342 59C403 109 431 165 431 225C431 308 366 395 238 395C212 395 165 379 127 364L153 550Z\"/></g></svg>).</span></span> The PSQI scores of the positive psychological symptoms were higher than those of the negative psychological symptoms.

Anion gap (AG) has been proved to be associated with prognosis of many cardiovascular diseases. This study is aimed at exploring the association of AG with inhospital all-cause mortality and adverse clinical outcomes in coronary care unit (CCU) patients. <i>Method</i>. All data of this study was extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III, version 1.4) database. All patients were divided into four groups according to AG quartiles. Primary outcome was inhospital all-cause mortality. Lowess smoothing curve was drawn to describe the overall trend of inhospital mortality. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent effect of AG on inhospital mortality. <i>Result</i>. A total of 3593 patients were enrolled in this study.

In this study, the alveolar bone destruction in periodontitis is hypothesized to be treated with novel Mg-Cu alloy grafts due to their antimicrobial and osteopromotive properties. In order to study this new strategy using Mg-Cu alloy grafts as a periodontal bone substitute, the <i>in vitro</i> degradation and antibacterial performance were examined. The pH variation and Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> release of Mg-Cu alloy extracts were measured. <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> (<i>P. gingivalis</i>) and <i>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</i> (<i>A. actinomycetemcomitans</i>), two common bacteria associated with periodontal disease, were cultured in Mg-Cu alloy extracts, and bacterial survival rate was evaluated. The changes of bacterial biofilm and its structure were revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), respectively. The results showed that the Mg-Cu alloy could significantly decrease the survival rates of both <i>P. gingivalis</i> and <i>A. actinomycetemcomitans</i>. Furthermore, the bacterial biofilms were completely destroyed in Mg-Cu alloy extracts, and the bacterial cell membranes were damaged, finally leading to bacterial apoptosis.

Previous studies have reported that the levels of PRDX2 were correlated with tumorigenicity, recurrence, and prognosis of patients with different cancers. We investigated the association between PRDX2 levels and the prognosis of lung cancer patients. We also measured PRDX2 expression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and examined its roles in the proliferation and migration <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. <i>Methods</i>. We used the Kaplan&#x2013;Meier plotter to analyze the survival of different levels of PRDX2 in lung cancer patients. The expression of PRDX2 in normal bronchial epithelial cell line and NSCLC cell lines was measured by qRT-PCR and western blot assays. Biological functions of NSCLC cells were detected by CCK8 and Transwell assays. We constructed tumor growth model using subcutaneously injection of nude mice and metastasis model by tail vein injection <i>in vivo</i>. The protein levels of proliferation related markers were measured by immunohistochemistry assay. Immunofluorescence method was used to detected EMT-related proteins. <i>Results</i>. The high levels of PRDX2 were associated with bad prognosis in lung cancer patients, especially in patients with adenocarcinoma. The expression of PRDX2 in NSCLC cell lines was higher than normal bronchial epithelial cells. Knockdown of PRDX2 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion in A549 cells, while overexpression of PRDX2 promoted the malignancy in NCI-H1299 cells <i>in vitro</i>. Silencing PRDX2 restrained tumor growth and repressed lung metastasis by EMT <i>in vivo</i>. <i>Conclusion</i>. Our data indicates that PRDX2 functions as a protumor regulator and is involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of lung cancer.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/8359860/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:36.217Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:36.217Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55117ca869ea531a5822da","title":"Identification of microRNA-451a as a Novel Circulating Biomarker for Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis","abstract":"<i>Background</i>.

To investigate the incidence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) after devascularization treatment and to explore the risk factors of perioperative PVT and PVT diagnosed during the follow-up period after surgery. <i>Methods</i>. We retrospectively reviewed medical records from cirrhosis patients who underwent devascularization for the treatment of portal hypertension in our hospital between January 1, 2008, and December 20, 2014. Patients were followed up to investigate the PVT incidence at different times after surgery. Patients were divided into two groups (PVT, no PVT), and the risk factors for PVT after surgery were determined. <i>Results</i>. Until October 16, 2015, the median follow-up time of the 124 patients enrolled into this study was 41.43 months (range, 5.47&#x2013;95.30 months). 61 patients had perioperative PVT, and 21 (16.94&#x0025;) patients had PVT diagnosed during the follow-up period. Those who had lower preoperative white blood cell counts, larger preoperative portal vein trunk diameter, and no gastric varices were more likely to have perioperative thrombosis. In those without perioperative PVT, a history of hypertension, higher grade of splenomegaly, and higher preoperative levels of creatinine were independent predictors of PVT occurrence during the follow-up period. <i>Conclusions</i>. The risk factors for perioperative PVT in cirrhotic patients after devascularization were lower preoperative white blood cell count and larger portal vein trunk diameter, with no gastric varices. A history of hypertension, a larger spleen, and higher preoperative creatinine level are independent predictors of PVT during follow-up after surgery in patients without perioperative PVT.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/9583706/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:36.217Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:36.217Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55117ca869ea531a5822db","title":"Development of an Immune Infiltration-Related Eight-Gene Prognostic Signature in Colorectal Cancer Microenvironment","abstract":"<i>Objective</i>.

Stromal/immune scores were calculated by the ESTIMATE algorithm. Correlation between prognosis/clinical characteristics and stromal/immune scores was assessed. Differentially expressed stromal and immune genes were identified. Their potential functions were annotated by functional enrichment analysis. Cox regression analysis was used to develop an eight-gene risk score model. Its predictive efficacies for 3 years, 5 years, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival interval (PFI) were evaluated using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The correlation between the risk score and the infiltering levels of six immune cells was analyzed using TIMER. The risk score was validated using an independent dataset. <i>Results</i>. Immune score was in a significant association with prognosis and clinical characteristics of CRC. 736 upregulated and two downregulated stromal and immune genes were identified, which were mainly enriched into immune-related biological processes and pathways. An-eight gene prognostic risk score model was conducted, consisting of CCL22, CD36, CPA3, CPT1C, KCNE4, NFATC1, RASGRP2, and SLC2A3. High risk score indicated a poor prognosis of patients. The area under the ROC curves (AUC) s of the model for 3 years, 5 years, OS, and PFI were 0.71, 0.70, 0.73, and 0.66, respectively. Thus, the model possessed well performance for prediction of patients’ prognosis, which was confirmed by an external dataset. Moreover, the risk score was significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration. <i>Conclusion</i>. Our study conducted an immune-related prognostic risk score model, which could provide novel targets for immunotherapy of CRC.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/2719739/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:36.217Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:36.217Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55117ca869ea531a5822d9","title":"Activities of Some Medicinal Plants on the Proliferation and Invasion of Brain Tumor Cell Lines","abstract":"Cancer is a debilitating disease that is on the increase in both developed and developing countries. Anticancer drugs are often expensive, have narrow spectrum of activities, and are associated with toxicities and side effects such as myelosuppression, immunosuppression, gastrointestinal disturbance, alopecia, skin toxicity, and hepatotoxicity. Plants have been the major source of anticancer drugs both in orthodox and traditional medicine. Many of the plants claimed by the traditional medicine practitioners (TMPs) to be effective in the treatment of cancer are yet to be evaluated scientifically. In this work, five medicinal plants used by TMPs in Borno State, Nigeria, were tested against two brain tumor cell lines.

Neither gene regulatory networks nor biomarkers to predict the prognostic outcomes have been elucidated in RTK. In this study, RNA sequencing data were obtained to identify differentially expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) between RTK samples and normal samples. A total of 4217 mRNAs, 284 lncRNAs, and 286 miRNAs were screened out. Of those, 103 mRNAs, 80 lncRNAs, and 45 miRNAs were identified for a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network, in which three significant modules were identified. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and the hub-gene cluster consisted of four core genes (EXOSC2, PAK1IP1, WDR43, and POLR1D) was selected. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were also performed to analyze the functional characteristics of differentially expressed mRNAs. Subsequently, among 211 mRNAs, 8 lncRNAs, and 12 miRNAs associated with overall survival (OS) obtained by univariate Cox analysis, 5 mRNAs, 7 lncRNAs, and 7 miRNAs were identified and the risk score formulas were constructed correspondingly using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model analysis. The log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to confirm the predictive value of the risk scores for OS in RTK patients. A genomic-clinicopathologic nomogram integrating the stage and risk scores based on RNAs was established and demonstrated high predictive accuracy and clinical value, which was validated through calibration curves, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, and decision curve analysis (DCA). In conclusion, this study not only provided potential insights into the mechanisms underlying RTK, but also presented a practicable tool for predicting the prognosis in children with RTK.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/5843874/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:36.217Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:36.217Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55117ca869ea531a5822df","title":"Human Papillomavirus Prevalence in Oral and Oropharyngeal Rinse and Gargle Specimens of Dental Patients and of an HIV-Positive Cohort from Pretoria, South Africa","abstract":"<i>Introduction</i>. Studies on HPV prevalence in the head and neck region of South Africans are sparse. Of the available reports in the literature, there were no studies on the association between HPV-DNA presence in the mouth and oropharynx in relation to high-risk behaviours such as oral sex practice or tobacco and alcohol use. <i>Materials and Methods</i>. Following ethical clearance and informed consent, patients attending a regional HIV-management clinic and patients attending a dental hospital were recruited to this study. The participants completed an interview-based questionnaire obtaining demographic information, data on HIV serostatus, and behavioural data including sexual practices and tobacco and alcohol use, and a rinse-and-gargle specimen was taken. Specimens were analysed for HPV DNA on 3 separate PCR/qPCR platforms. Statistical analyses were performed for associations between the study group and categorical variables, HPV status, and data from the questionnaires. <i>Results</i>. Of 221 participants, 149 were from a general population and 72 from the HIV-management clinic. Smokers comprised 29.4&#x0025; of the sample, and 45.2&#x0025; of participants reported to have ever used alcohol. Open mouth kissing during teenage years was confirmed by 64.7&#x0025; of participants, 40.3&#x0025; have given oral sex with their mouth, and 44.8&#x0025; confirmed to have received oral sex from their partner&#x2019;s mouth. Seven participants (3.2&#x0025;) had detectable <i>&#x3b1;</i>-HPV DNA, and 1 (0.4&#x0025;) had detectable <i>&#x3b2;</i>-HPV DNA in their rinse-and-gargle specimens. Two participants were from the HIV-management clinic and 6 from the general dental population (overall 3.6&#x0025;). <i>Conclusion</i>. Five high-risk HPV, 2 low-risk HPV, and one <i>&#x3b2;</i>-HPV types were detected. The low prevalence of 3.6&#x0025; compares well to similar studies in different cohorts studied in South Africa and falls within the global oral/oropharyngeal prevalence spectrum. Only 4 participants, all from the HIV-management clinic, had palatine tonsils. No significant relationships were found between HPV presence and demographic data or sexual, oral sexual, tobacco use, or alcohol use, and no associations were seen with numbers of sexual and oral-sex partners.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/av/2020/2395219/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:36.217Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:42:36.217Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55117ca869ea531a5822dd","title":"Treatment with Hyaluronic Acid and Collagen-Polyvinylpyrrolidone Improves Extracellular Matrix Assembly for Scarring after Tracheal Resection","abstract":"Treatment of tracheal stenosis is occasionally performed in combination with wound healing modulators to manipulate new extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and prevent fibrosis.

With the development of next-generation sequencing technology, more and more types of genomic features, such as mRNA expression level, can be used to distinguish cancer patients. Previous studies commonly stratified patients by using a single type of genomic features, which can only reflect one aspect of the cancer. In fact, multiscale genomic features will provide more information and may be helpful for clinical prediction. In addition, most of the conventional machine learning algorithms use a handcrafted gene set as features to construct models, which is generally selected by a statistical method with an arbitrary cut-off, e.g., <svg xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"vertical-align:-3.42943pt\" id=\"M1\" height=\"10.2124pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"-0.0498162 -6.78297 7.83752 10.2124\" width=\"7.83752pt\"><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,0,0)\"><path id=\"g113-113\" d=\"M570 304C570 398 525 448 414 448C385 448 343 445 312 434L329 511L321 518C297 504 262 482 244 460L233 411C195 397 159 381 128 358L135 332C160 347 189 360 224 373L111 -147C97 -210 84 -218 17 -231L13 -257L254 -247L259 -218L233 -216C183 -212 177 -202 189 -142L218 -1C238 -10 266 -12 283 -12C351 3 429 48 483 105C543 168 570 242 570 304ZM482 289C482 161 380 33 304 33C278 33 248 51 233 69L303 396C326 400 352 403 369 403C428 403 482 380 482 289Z\"/></g></svg> value &lt; 0.05. The genes in the gene set are not necessarily related to the cancer and will make the model unreliable. Therefore, in our study, we thoroughly investigated the performance of different machine learning methods on stratifying breast cancer patients with a single type of genomic features. Then, we proposed a strategy, which can take into account the degree of correlation between genes and cancer patients, to identify the features from mRNAs and microRNAs, and evaluated the performance of the models with the new combined features of the multiscale genomic features. The results showed that, compared with the models constructed with a single type of features, the models with the multiscale genomic features generated by our proposed method achieved better performance on stratifying the ER status of breast cancer patients. Moreover, we found that the identified multiscale genomic features were closely related to the cancer by gene set enrichment analysis, indicating that our proposed strategy can well reflect the biological relevance of the genes to breast cancer. In conclusion, modelling with multiscale genomic features closely related to the cancer not only can guarantee the prediction performance of the models but also can effectively provide candidate genes for interpreting the mechanisms of cancer.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/1475368/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:02.053Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:02.053Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f551196a869ea531a5822e2","title":"A System Biology-Based Approach for Designing Combination Therapy in Cancer Precision Medicine","abstract":"In this paper, we have used an agent-based stochastic tumor growth model and presented a mathematical and theoretical perspective to cancer therapy.

In recent years, health insurance (HI) has been chosen by many low- and middle-income countries to obtain an important health policy target&#x2014;universal health coverage. Vietnam has recently introduced the Revised Health Insurance Law, and the effects of the voluntary health insurance (VHI) and heavily subsidised health insurance (HSHI) programmes have not yet been analysed. Therefore, this study is aimed at examining the impact of these HI programmes on the utilisation of health care services and out-of-pocket health expenditure (OOP) in general and across different health care providers in particular. <i>Methods</i>. Using the two waves of Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys 2014 and 2016 and the difference-in-difference method, the impacts of VHI and HSHI on health care utilisation and OOP in Vietnam were estimated. <i>Results</i>. For both the VHI and HSHI groups, we found that HI increased the probability of seeking outpatient care, the mean number of outpatient visits, the total number of visits, and the mean number of visits at the district level of health care providers in the last 12 months. However, there was no evidence that the HSHI programmes increased the mean number of inpatient visits and the number of visits at the provincial hospital. We also found that while the VHI programme reduced OOP for both outpatient and inpatient care, the HSHI scheme did not result in a reduction in OOP for hospitalisation, although HI lowered the total OOP. Similarly, we found that for both groups, HI reduced OOP when the insured visited district and provincial hospitals. However, the statistically significant impact was not demonstrated when the enrolees of HSHI programmes visited provincial hospitals. <i>Conclusion</i>. The study offers evidence that the Vietnamese HI scheme increased health care service utilisation and decreased OOP for the participants of the VHI and HSHI programmes. Therefore, the government should continue to consider improving the HI system as a strategy to achieve universal health coverage.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/9065287/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:02.054Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:02.054Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f551196a869ea531a5822e5","title":"SAMA: A Fast Self-Adaptive Memetic Algorithm for Detecting SNP-SNP Interactions Associated with Disease","abstract":"Detecting SNP-SNP interactions associated with disease is significant in genome-wide association study (GWAS).

In this method, the crossover, mutation, and selection of standard memetic algorithm are improved to make SAMA adapt to the detection of SNP-SNP interactions associated with disease. Furthermore, a self-adaptive local search algorithm is introduced to enhance the detecting power of the proposed method. SAMA is evaluated on a variety of simulated datasets and a real-world biological dataset, and a comparative study between it and the other four methods (FHSA-SED, AntEpiSeeker, IEACO, and DESeeker) that have been developed recently based on evolutionary algorithms is performed. The results of extensive experiments show that SAMA outperforms the other four compared methods in terms of detection power and running time.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/5610658/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:02.054Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:02.054Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f551196a869ea531a5822e6","title":"Risk Factors for Rebleeding after Emergency Endoscopic Treatment of Dieulafoy Lesion","abstract":"<i>Background and Objective</i>: Dieulafoy lesion is a rare, but life-threatening, cause of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and endoscopic therapy is the preferred first-line treatment.

then the clip was removed and the RCCA was not ligated. For Group B, the middle part of RCCA was treated the same way as Group A and the RCCA was not ligated. For Group C, the middle part of RCCA was treated as Group B, but the distal RCCA was ligated. After the aneurysm models were created for 3 weeks, prior to sacrificing the animals, color Doppler ultrasound and angiography were performed for blood flow measurements inside the aneurysms. Histological analysis (such as SMA-<i>α</i>, CD31, CD34, CD68, collagen IV, and Ki67) and the other relevant indexes were compared between the ideal model’s aneurysmal tissues and the human intracranial aneurysm’s tissues to confirm whether we have successfully established elastase-induced aneurysm models. <i>Results</i>. Compared with human intracranial aneurysm specimens by the color Doppler ultrasound, angiography, and changes in the inner diameter of arteries, all three methods have successfully established the elastase-induced aneurysm models. Histology showed that biological responses were similar to both human cerebral aneurysms and previously published elastase-induced rabbit aneurysm models. Group A and Group B had the same morphology, but Group A had a higher mortality rate than Group B. Group B and Group C had different morphology. The aneurysm of Group C was more similar to human cerebral aneurysms but had a higher mortality rate than Group B. Group B was confirmed not only as an alternative method but also as a more safe and effective method for creating elastase-induced aneurysm models. <i>Conclusion</i>. Through analysis and comparison, the Group B is proven to be the simplest, reproducible, and most effective modeling method. The aneurysm model established by Group B can be used for basic research related to aneurysm mechanism. We have provided a new and effective method for basic research on aneurysm.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6707012/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:02.053Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:02.053Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f551196a869ea531a5822e8","title":"Comprehensive Characterization of Prognostic Long Noncoding RNAs in Osteosarcoma","abstract":"The molecular mechanism of osteosarcoma (OS) based on protein-coding genes has largely been studied in the past decades. However, much remains to be explored when it comes to the role that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play in the pathogenesis and progression of OS and how they are associated with OS metastasis. In the present study, we collected RNA-seq-based gene expression data of 82 OS samples from the Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database, along with their clinical information. We found that 50 lncRNAs were significantly associated with patients&#x2019; survival by univariable Cox regression model. Moreover, we built multivariable Cox regression model based on 7 lncRNAs and successfully stratified patients into two risk groups, which exhibited significantly different prognostic outcomes. Significantly enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways detected by differential expression analysis on DEGs between the two groups with different prognostic outcomes were both immune-related, indicating that such GO terms and pathways are critical for OS survival. Among the seven lncRNA signatures, <i>AC011442.1</i> was predicted to act as an oncogenic driver in OS by correlation analysis of copy number alteration (CNA) and lncRNA expression, and it was predicted to regulate AMPK and hedgehog signaling pathways. In summary, the identification of novel prognostic lncRNAs in OS could not only improved our understanding of the lncRNAs involved in OS tumorigenesis or progression but also assist the diagnosis and development of molecularly targeted therapies for OS, which in turn benefit patients&#x2019; survival.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6725753/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:02.054Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:02.054Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f551196a869ea531a5822e9","title":"The Expression and Potential Role of Tubulin Alpha 1b in Wilms’ Tumor","abstract":"We explored the difference in expression of tubulin alpha 1b (TUBA1B) between Wilms’ tumor (WT) and normal tissues (NT) from in-house patients and databases, to determine TUBA1B expression in WT and the predictive pathways of coexpressed genes.

The website of WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis toolkit were used to analyze the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional annotations for the overlapped genes. The results showed that the relative expression of TUBA1B in WT tissues from in-house three patients was 280.0086, 141.7589, and 303.8292 and that in NT was 16.5836, 104.8141, and 12.79 (3 WT

Plants are considered inexpensive and facile production platforms for recombinant monoclonal antibody (mAb) due to the latest advancements and diversification of transgenic techniques. Current human biologics, including those based on mAbs produced by fermentation technologies using primarily mammalian cell cultures, have been replaced by plant-produced mAbs, which are cost effective, more scalable, speedy, versatile, and safer. Moreover, the use of animals for antibody production is always a question of ethical unambiguity, and the suitability of animal models for predicting the immunogenicity of therapeutic mAbs in humans and transposition of the immunogenic potential of therapeutic antibodies in animals to the human situation has no scientific rationale. Quite a few plant-based mAbs are approved for the treatment of cancer, ranging from tumors to hematological malignancies. This review focuses on the cutting-edge approaches for using plant-derived mAbs to suppress or prevent cancers. It also discusses the avenues taken to prevent infection by oncogenic viruses, solid tumors, lymphomas, and other cancerous conditions using mAbs. The review emphasizes the use of a plant-derived monoclonal antibody as a premier platform to combat cancer.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/3038564/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:20.562Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:20.562Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5511a8a869ea531a5822ec","title":"The Determinant of DNA Repair Pathway Choices in Ionising Radiation-Induced DNA Double-Strand Breaks","abstract":"Ionising radiation- (IR-) induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are considered to be the deleterious DNA lesions that pose a serious threat to genomic stability. The major DNA repair pathways, including classical nonhomologous end joining, homologous recombination, single-strand annealing, and alternative end joining, play critical roles in countering and eliciting IR-induced DSBs to ensure genome integrity. If the IR-induced DNA DSBs are not repaired correctly, the residual or incorrectly repaired DSBs can result in genomic instability that is associated with certain human diseases. Although many efforts have been made in investigating the major mechanisms of IR-induced DNA DSB repair, it is still unclear what determines the choices of IR-induced DNA DSB repair pathways. In this review, we discuss how the mechanisms of IR-induced DSB repair pathway choices can operate in irradiated cells. We first briefly describe the main mechanisms of the major DNA DSB repair pathways and the related key repair proteins. Based on our understanding of the characteristics of IR-induced DNA DSBs and the regulatory mechanisms of DSB repair pathways in irradiated cells and recent advances in this field, We then highlight the main factors and associated challenges to determine the IR-induced DSB repair pathway choices. We conclude that the type and distribution of IR-induced DSBs, chromatin state, DNA-end structure, and DNA-end resection are the main determinants of the choice of the IR-induced DNA DSB repair pathway.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/4834965/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:20.562Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:20.562Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5511a8a869ea531a5822ed","title":"A Modified Murine Calvarial Osteolysis Model Exposed to Ti Particles in Aseptic Loosening","abstract":"<i>Aim</i>. To investigate the different effects on osteolysis between commercial pure Ti particles and TiAl6V4 particles obtained from prosthesis of patients with aseptic loosening. <i>Method</i>. Scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction were used for the size test, chemical composition test, and phase analysis of two kinds of Ti particles. Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and 3-dimensional reconstruction analysis were applied to analyze the bone loss quantitatively and radiologically. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining were used to assess the histologic difference. <i>Result</i>. TiAl6V4 particles were constituted by FeO, Al<sub>45</sub>V<sub>7</sub>, and Al<sub>3</sub>Ti while pure Ti particles were constituted by Ti, Ti<sub>3</sub>O, and C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>7</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>. Similar particle size of nanoscale was detected of two Ti particles. A TiAl6V4 osteolysis model had more severe bone loss when scanned with micro-CT and assessed by quantitative analysis. TiAl6V4 also presented deeper and wider calvarial bone loss in HE staining and more activated osteoclasts in TRAP staining. <i>Conclusion</i>. A mouse calvarial model is the most effective animal model for the primary in vivo research of aseptic loosening. Compared with commercial Ti particles, TiAl6V4 particles derived from prosthesis of an aseptic loosening patient had more severe bone loss and more activated osteoclast, which was more consistent with pathogenesis of aseptic loosening <i>in vivo</i>, had high success rate of establishment of a model, and was more desired in animal modeling.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/3403489/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:20.562Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:20.562Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5511a8a869ea531a5822ea","title":"In Vivo Antimalarial Activity of Crude Fruit Extract of Capsicum frutescens Var.

The alarming spread of parasite resistance to current antimalarial agents is threatening malaria controlling efforts. This, consequently, urged the scientific community to discover novel antimalarial drugs. Successful and most potent antimalarial drugs were obtained from medicinal plants. <i>Capsicum frutescens</i> is claimed to possess an antiplasmodial activity in Ethiopian and Ugandan folkloric medicine. However, there is a lack of pharmacological evidence for its antiplasmodial activity. This study, hence, was aimed at evaluating the <i>in vivo</i> antiplasmodial activity of <i>C. frutescens</i> in a mouse model. <i>Methods</i>. The dried fruits of the plant were extracted with 80% methanol using cold maceration. A 4-day suppressive test was employed to ascertain the claimed antiplasmodial effect of the plant. Following inoculation with <i>P. berghei</i>, mice in treatment groups were provided with three dose levels (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) of the extract, while 2% Tween 80 and chloroquine served as the negative and positive controls, respectively.

The results showed that TCDD-activated DCs could promote Th1 and Th17 differentiation in patients with PBC. Therefore, this study demonstrated TCDD as an AhR agonist in regulating na&#x00EF;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation in patients with PBC.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/1754975/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:20.562Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:20.562Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5511a8a869ea531a5822ef","title":"TRIM33 Overexpression Inhibits the Progression of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma In Vivo and In Vitro","abstract":"<i>Purpose</i>. To evaluate the expression of tripartite motif-containing 33 (TRIM33) in ccRCC tissues and explore the biological effect of TRIM33 on the progress of ccRCC. <i>Method</i>. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to examine the mRNA expression levels of TRIM33 in ccRCC tissues and its clinical relevance. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to evaluate its expression in ccRCC tissues obtained from our hospital. The correlation between TRIM33 expression and clinicopathological features of the patients was also investigated. The effects of TRIM33 on the proliferation of ccRCC cells were examined using the CCK-8 and colony formation assays. The effects of TRIM33 on the migration and invasion of ccRCC cells were explored through wound healing and transwell assays, along with the use of Wnt signaling pathway agonists in rescue experiments. Western blotting was used to explore the potential mechanism of TRIM33 in renal cancer cells. A xenograft model was used to explore the effect of TRIM33 on tumor growth. <i>Result</i>. Bioinformatics analysis showed that TRIM33 mRNA expression in ccRCC tissues was downregulated, and low TRIM33 expression was related to poor prognosis in ccRCC patients. In agreement with this, low TRIM33 expression was detected in human ccRCC tissues. TRIM33 expression levels were correlated with clinical characteristics, including tumor size and Furman&#x2019;s grade. Furthermore, TRIM33 overexpression inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of 786-O and ACHN cell lines. The rescue experiment showed that the originally inhibited migration and invasion capabilities were restored. TRIM33 overexpression reduced the expression levels of <i>&#x03B2;</i>-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-myc, and inhibited tumor growth in ccRCC cells in vivo. <i>Conclusion</i>. TRIM33 exhibits an abnormally low expression in human ccRCC tissues. TRIM33 may serve as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker for ccRCC.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/8409239/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:20.563Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:20.563Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5511a8a869ea531a5822f0","title":"Transcription Factors That Regulate the Pathogenesis of Ulcerative Colitis","abstract":"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) characterized by occurrence in the rectum and sigmoid colon of young adults. However, the functional roles of transcription factors (TFs) and their regulating target genes and pathways are not fully known in ulcerative colitis (UC). In this study, we collected gene expression data to identify differentially expressed TFs (DETFs). We found that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in the target genes of <i>HOXA2</i>, <i>IKZF1</i>, <i>KLF2</i>, <i>XBP1</i>, <i>EGR2</i>, <i>ETV7</i>, <i>BACH2</i>, <i>CBFA2T3</i>, <i>HLF</i>, and <i>NFE2</i>. TFs including <i>BACH2</i>, <i>CBFA2T3</i>, <i>EGR2</i>, <i>ETV7</i>, <i>NFE2</i>, and <i>XBP1</i>, and their target genes were significantly enriched in signaling by interleukins. BACH2 target genes were enriched in estrogen receptor- (ESR-) mediated signaling and nongenomic estrogen signaling. Furthermore, to clarify the functional roles of immune cells on the UC pathogenesis, we estimated the immune cell proportions in all the samples. The accumulated effector CD8 and reduced proportion of na&#x00EF;ve CD4 might be responsible for the adaptive immune response in UC. The accumulation of plasma in UC might be associated with increased gut permeability. In summary, we present a systematic study of the TFs by analyzing the DETFs, their regulating target genes and pathways, and immune cells. These findings might improve our understanding of the TFs in the pathogenesis of UC.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/7402657/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:20.563Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:20.563Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5511a8a869ea531a5822f2","title":"Changes in Blood Profile from Steady State in Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia Admitted for Vaso-occlusive Crisis and Acute Chest Syndrome","abstract":"Close to half of all patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) will have at least one episode of acute chest syndrome (ACS) during their lifetime.

Worldwide, about 3.5 billion people are affected by intestinal parasitic infections, and the majority of them are children. A perusal of the literature indicates that in Ethiopia, nearly one-third of schoolchildren are found to be infected by some sort of intestinal parasites. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites among schoolchildren in Rama town in Northern Ethiopia. <i>Methods</i>. A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted among primary school children from two schools in Rama town during June 2017. A structured questionnaire was used to identify environmental, sociodemographic, and behavioral factors while stool specimens were collected and examined for parasites using direct wet smear with saline preparation. Data analysis was completed using the Statistical Program for Social Sciences version 24 statistical software. <i>Results</i>. A total of 312 school children with a mean age of 11.3 years were included. Among them, 24.4% (76) were found to be positive for at least one of the parasites. The overall infection rate was the highest among the 10–14 age groups (26.7%). Females were predominantly infected (26.7%). Altogether, eight species of intestinal parasites were identified. The most predominant protozoan and helminths were <i>E. histolytica</i>/<i>dispar</i> (10.9%) and <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> (7.4%), respectively, and infections were mostly mono-parasitic. Coinfections with two and three intestinal parasites were identified among 13 (4.2%, [13/302]) and 2 (0.6%, [2/302]) cases, respectively. Prevalence of intestinal parasites was higher among children who did not wash their hands regularly before meals (AOR: 2.30, CI: 1.32, 4.0, <svg xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"vertical-align:-3.42943pt\" id=\"M1\" height=\"10.2124pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"-0.0498162 -6.78297 7.83752 10.2124\" width=\"7.83752pt\"><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,0,0)\"><path id=\"g113-113\" d=\"M570 304C570 398 525 448 414 448C385 448 343 445 312 434L329 511L321 518C297 504 262 482 244 460L233 411C195 397 159 381 128 358L135 332C160 347 189 360 224 373L111 -147C97 -210 84 -218 17 -231L13 -257L254 -247L259 -218L233 -216C183 -212 177 -202 189 -142L218 -1C238 -10 266 -12 283 -12C351 3 429 48 483 105C543 168 570 242 570 304ZM482 289C482 161 380 33 304 33C278 33 248 51 233 69L303 396C326 400 352 403 369 403C428 403 482 380 482 289Z\"/></g></svg> &lt; 0.001) and those who frequently swam in streams (AOR: 3.12, CI: 1.07, 9.08, <svg xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"vertical-align:-3.42943pt\" id=\"M2\" height=\"10.2124pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"-0.0498162 -6.78297 7.83752 10.2124\" width=\"7.83752pt\"><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,0,0)\"><use xlink:href=\"#g113-113\"/></g></svg> &lt; 0.021). <i>Conclusions</i>.

Accumulating evidences indicate that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are closely correlated with tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms of circRNAs still remain unclear. This study is aimed at determining hub genes and circRNAs and analyzing their potential biological functions in GC. Expression profiles of mRNAs and circRNAs were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets of GC and paracancer tissues. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed circRNAs (DE-circRNAs) were identified. The target miRNAs of DE-circRNAs and the bidirectional interaction between target miRNAs and DEGs were predicted. Functional analysis was performed, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network were established. A total of 456 DEGs and 2 DE-circRNAs were identified with 3 mRNA expression profiles and 2 circRNA expression profiles. GO analysis indicated that DEGs were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix and cell adhesion, and KEGG confirmed that DEGs were mainly associated with focal adhesion, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, extracellular matrix- (ECM)- receptor interaction, and gastric acid secretion. 15 hub DEGs (BGN, COL1A1, COL1A2, FBN1, FN1, SPARC, SPP1, TIMP1, UBE2C, CCNB1, CD44, CXCL8, COL3A1, COL5A2, and THBS1) were identified from the PPI network. Furthermore, the survival analysis indicate that GC patients with a high expression of the following 9 hub DEGs, namely, BGN, COL1A1, COL1A2, FBN1, FN1, SPARC, SPP1, TIMP1, and UBE2C, had significantly worse overall survival. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed based on 1 circRNA, 15 miRNAs, and 45 DEGs. In addition, the 45 DEGs included 5 hub DEGs. These results suggested that hub DEGs and circRNAs could be implicated in the pathogenesis and development of GC. Our findings provide novel evidence on the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network and lay the foundation for future research of circRNAs in GC.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/2862701/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:36.105Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:36.105Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5511b8a869ea531a5822f6","title":"Quercetin Downregulates Cyclooxygenase-2 Expression and HIF-1α/VEGF Signaling-Related Angiogenesis in a Mouse Model of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm","abstract":"<i>Objective</i>. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development has been characterized by increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which contributes to angiogenesis via cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Quercetin, one of the most common and well-researched flavonoids and abundant in vegetables and fruits, has beneficial effects in inhibiting angiogenesis. This study investigated the antiangiogenic effects of quercetin on experimental aneurysms. <i>Methods</i>. We utilized the in vivo AAA mouse model induced by the periaortic application of CaCl<sub>2</sub> to examine the effectiveness of quercetin in blocking angiogenesis. Quercetin was administered at 60&#x2009;mg/kg once daily on the day of the AAA induction and then continued for 6 weeks. Celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, was used as the positive control. <i>Results</i>. Our results demonstrated that quercetin significantly attenuated aneurysm growth in AAA mice and medial neovascularization. Accordingly, quercetin decreased the expression of proangiogenic mediators, including VEGF-A, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and vascular endothelial cadherin. Quercetin treatment also inhibited the expression of COX-2 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1<i>&#x03B1;</i> (HIF-1<i>&#x03B1;</i>). It was also found that quercetin-3-glucuronide, a major quercetin metabolite, downregulated the expression of COX-2, HIF-1<i>&#x03B1;</i>, VEGF-A, and matrix metalloproteinase activities in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from AAA mice. <i>Conclusion</i>.

To compare the mechanical similarities between gelatin and biological tissues, different concentrations of gelatin samples were subjected to tensile, compression, and indentation tests and compared with porcine liver tissue. The loading rate in the three tests fully considered the surgical application conditions; notably, a loading speed up to 12&#x2009;mm/s was applied in the indentation testing, the tensile test was performed at a speed of 1&#x2009;mm/s until fracture, and the compression tests were compressed at a rate of 0.16&#x2009;mm/s and 1&#x2009;mm/s. A comparison of the results shows that the mechanical behaviors of low-concentration gelatin samples involved in the study are similar to the mechanical behavior of porcine liver tissue. The results of the gelatin material were mathematically expressed by the Mooney-Rivlin model and the Prony series. The results show that the material properties of gelatin can mimic the range of mechanical characteristics of porcine liver, and gelatin can be used as a matrix to further improve the similarity between substitute materials and biological tissues.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/7021636/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:36.105Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T16:43:36.105Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552256ae9a4c4f652b3a88","title":"Ensemble Learning Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions Using GIST Descriptor Extracted from PSSM-Based Evolutionary Information","abstract":"Identifying the drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays an essential role in new drug development. However, there still has the limited knowledge of DTIs and a significant number of unknown DTI pairs. Moreover, the traditional experimental methods have inevitable disadvantages such as high cost and time-consuming. Therefore, developing computational methods for predicting DTIs is attracting more and more attention. In this study, we report a novel computational approach for predicting DTI using GIST feature, position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), and rotation forest (RF). Specifically, each target protein is first converted into a PSSM for retaining evolutionary information. Then, the GIST feature is extracted from PSSM and substructure fingerprint information is adopted to extract the feature of the drug. Finally, combining each protein and drug features to form a new drug-target pair, which is employed as input feature for RF classifier. In the experiment, the proposed method achieves high average accuracies of 89.25&#x0025;, 85.93&#x0025;, 82.36&#x0025;, and 73.89&#x0025; on <i>enzyme, ion channel, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and nuclear receptor,</i> respectively. For further evaluating the prediction performance of the proposed method, we compare it with the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the same golden standard dataset. These promising results illustrate that the proposed method is more effective and stable than other methods.

Accumulation of unused and expired medicines at home is a source of environmental hazards and public health problems due to lack of awareness on appropriate medicine disposal methods. Therefore, the study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of unused and expired medicine disposal among patients visiting Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. <i>Methods.</i> A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 384 patients who visited Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital outpatient pharmacy from April to June 2019. Convenience sampling was used to recruit the participants, and data was collected by a face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire. The data were entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 21.0. Descriptive statistics on sample characteristics was computed, and results were presented in the form percentage using table and statements. <i>Results</i>. Out of the 384 respondents included in the study, 205 (53.4&#x0025;) of them were males. More than half (199 (51.8&#x0025;)) of the respondents did not correctly knew about medicine waste, and 233 (60.7&#x0025;) of them did not have any prior information regarding medicine waste disposal instruction. But 351 (91.4&#x0025;) of the participants correctly responded that inappropriate unused and expired medicine disposal can cause environmental harm. Above half (218 (56.8&#x0025;)) of the respondents &#x201C;agreed&#x201D; about the potential risks related to having unused/expired medicines at home, and 206 (53.6&#x0025;) of them &#x201C;strongly agreed&#x201D; that children are more vulnerable. One hundred fifty-nine respondents had unused/expired medicines in their homes. The most commonly used disposal practice for unused medicines were throwing them in a household trash as reported by 297 (77.3&#x0025;) followed by flushing unused medications in toilet/sink 152 (39.6&#x0025;). Throwing them away in household garbage and flushing them in toilet/sink were also the most commonly preferred disposal practice for expired medicines. <i>Conclusion</i>. The majority of the study participants dispose unused and expired medicine in household garbage and toilet/sink. This is against the recommendations of both national and international policies and guidelines on safe and appropriate pharmaceutical waste disposal.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/9538127/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:54:30.623Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:54:30.623Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552256ae9a4c4f652b3a8b","title":"Development of an MS Workflow Based on Combining Database Search Engines for Accurate Protein Identification and Its Validation to Identify the Serum Proteomic Profile in Female Stress Urinary Incontinence","abstract":"A critical stage of shotgun proteomics is database search, a process which attempts to match the experimental spectra to the theoretical one. Given the considerable time and effort spent in analysis, it is self-evident for a researcher to aspire for rigorous computational analysis and a more confident and accurate peptide/protein identification. Mass spectrometry (MS) has been applied across several clinical disciplines. The pathophysiology of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI), caused by a damaged pelvic floor, has become a boundless disease altering the quality of life worldwide. Although some studies pointed markers that can be bioindicators for SUI, these findings raise the issue of sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, it is critical to have a sensitive and specific analytical approach to identify markers that have been associated with protective and deleterious associations in disease. Here, we describe our designed and developed workflow for protein identification from tandem mass spectrometry that uses multiple search engines. We apply our workflow to an existing study addressing the pathophysiology of SUI. We demonstrate how using the combined approach together with high-performance computing techniques can surmount the challenges of complex analyses and extended computing time. We also compare the relative performance of each combination. Our results suggest that a combination of MS-GF+ and COMET represents the best sensitivity-specificity trade-off, outperforming all other tested combinations. The approach was also sensitive and accurately identified a set of protein that was shown to be markers for categories of diseases associated with the pathophysiology of SUI. This workflow was developed to encourage proteomic researchers to adopt MS-based techniques for accurate analysis and to promote MS as a routine tool to the clinical cohorts.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/8740468/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:54:30.624Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:54:30.624Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552256ae9a4c4f652b3a89","title":"Comediation of Erythrocyte Haemolysis by Erythrocyte-Derived Microparticles and Complement during Malaria Infection","abstract":"<i>Background</i>. Due to the sustained morbidity and mortality that malaria-associated anaemia imposes on patients, malaria is still a global threat, most especially, to residents in sub-Saharan Africa. Merozoite invasion and destruction of erythrocytes, a target for this study, have been necessary due to its unique nature and also since the erythrocytes suffer the most brunt of malarial infection leading to anaemia. The issue of malaria anaemia has to do with why uninfected RBCs get destroyed and even more so than infected ones. Studies have proposed that cytophilic anti-RSP2 (ring surface protein 2—merozoite rhoptry protein 2) antibodies present in sera enhance phagocytosis of RSP2-tagged RBCs by macrophages either directly or via complement, while others have proposed transfer of RSP2 to both infected and uninfected RBCs which may render them susceptible to phagocytosis. What is missing is the agent involved in the transfer of these parasite-induced surface proteins onto the uninfected RBCs, i.e., the mediator molecules. Considering the intracellular location of the parasite in the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane and the absence of a transport mechanism such as the Golgi apparatus within the mature RBC, since the latter has no nucleus, we propose that erythrocyte-derived microparticles (EMPs) may be the possible mediators. <i>Aim</i>. This study aimed at examining the immunological interactions between EMPs released during malarial infections and host erythrocytes that may lead to their lysis possibly through complement mediation. <i>Methods</i>. This was an experimental study during which malarial EMPs were isolated by differential centrifugation of malaria-positive plasma. This was followed by cell-based in vitro assays where malaria-positive EMPs were added to uninfected blood group “O” negative erythrocytes in the presence of complement and haemolysis checked for. <i>Results and Conclusion.</i> At a fixed volume of 50 <i>μ</i>L complement, there were statistically significant (<span class=\"inline_break\"><svg xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"18.973pt\" style=\"vertical-align:-3.42938pt\" id=\"M1\" height=\"11.7782pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"-0.0498162 -8.34882 18.973 11.7782\"><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,0,0)\"><path id=\"g113-113\" d=\"M570 304C570 398 525 448 414 448C385 448 343 445 312 434L329 511L321 518C297 504 262 482 244 460L233 411C195 397 159 381 128 358L135 332C160 347 189 360 224 373L111 -147C97 -210 84 -218 17 -231L13 -257L254 -247L259 -218L233 -216C183 -212 177 -202 189 -142L218 -1C238 -10 266 -12 283 -12C351 3 429 48 483 105C543 168 570 242 570 304ZM482 289C482 161 380 33 304 33C278 33 248 51 233 69L303 396C326 400 352 403 369 403C428 403 482 380 482 289Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,11.342,0)\"><path id=\"g117-91\" d=\"M512 -3V55L134 254V256L512 456V514L75 281V230L512 -3Z\"/></g></svg><span class=\"irelop\"/><span class=\"nowrap\"><svg xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"21.921pt\" style=\"vertical-align:-3.42938pt\" height=\"11.7782pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"22.555183800000002 -8.34882 21.921 11.7782\"><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,22.605,0)\"><path id=\"g113-49\" d=\"M241 635C89 635 35 457 35 312C35 153 89 -12 240 -12C390 -12 443 166 443 312C443 466 390 635 241 635ZM238 602C329 602 354 454 354 312C354 172 330 22 240 22C152 22 124 173 124 313S148 602 238 602Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,28.845,0)\"><path id=\"g113-47\" d=\"M113 -12C146 -12 170 11 170 46C170 78 146 103 114 103S58 78 58 46C58 11 82 -12 113 -12Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,31.809,0)\"><use xlink:href=\"#g113-49\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,38.049,0)\"><path id=\"g113-50\" d=\"M384 0V27C293 34 287 42 287 114V635C232 613 172 594 109 583V559L157 557C201 555 205 550 205 499V114C205 42 199 34 109 27V0H384Z\"/></g></svg>)</span></span> increases in mean percentage haemolysis as the volume of EMPs increased.

Also, a correlation was found between sex and the fact of being involved in physical activity, as well as the subjects&#x2019; knowledge of diet and supplementation in sport.<i> Conclusion. </i>High prevalence of dietary supplement use was found in our study population, but still significant percentage of the study group demonstrate inaccurate information about these products. Hence, there is an urgent need to provide the community with education and access to scientific and unbiased information.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9629531/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:54:30.624Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:54:30.624Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552256ae9a4c4f652b3a8f","title":"Study Insights into Gastrointestinal Cancer through the Gut Microbiota","abstract":"The gut microbiome in human is recognized as a &#x201c;microbial organ&#x201d; for its roles and contributions in regulating the human homeostasis and metabolism.

Mongolian aDNA samples tested in this study carried all three types of the SNP (A/T, A/A, and T/T) with no distinctly predominant type observed. In contrast, Korean aDNA samples carried the Asian genotype (T/T), while the Uzbekistan aDNA samples carried the European genotype (A/A) more often than the Asian genotype (T/T). <i>Conclusions</i>. Human Mongolian aDNA samples had A/T, A/A, and T/T SNP rs1545397 with no distinct predominant genotype. When combined with the archeological and aDNA studies of other coupling morphologies with aDNA, our results infer that Mongolia’s prehistoric population had considerable heterogeneity of skin color and morphological traits and that in the Neolithic period, a Eurasian or mixed population inhabited the western part of Mongolia.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/2585324/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:54:30.624Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:54:30.624Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552264ae9a4c4f652b3a91","title":"Current Research Progress on Long Noncoding RNAs Associated with Hepatocellular Carcinoma","abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of mortality among cancers.

The generated gas mixture of smoking is proved to contain about 4,500 components such as carbon monoxide, nicotine, oxidants, fine particulate matter, and aldehydes. These components were considered to be the principle factor driving the pathogenesis and progression of pulmonary disease. A large proportion of lung cancer patients showed a history of COPD, which demonstrated that there might be a close relationship between COPD and lung cancer. In the early stages of smoking, lung barrier provoked protective response and DNA repair are likely to suppress these changes to a certain extent. In the presence of long-term smoking exposure, these mechanisms seem to be malfunctioned and lead to disease progression. The infiltration of inflammatory cells to mucosa, submucosa, and glandular tissue caused by inhaled cigarette smoke is responsible for the destruction of matrix, blood supply shortage, and epithelial cell death. Conversely, cancer cells have the capacity to modulate the proliferation of epithelial cells and produce of new vascular networks. Comprehension understanding of mechanisms responsible for both pathologies is necessary for the prevention and treatment of COPD and lung cancer.

How PC1 regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis has been studied for decades but the underlying mechanisms remain controversial. Protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) is activated by interferons or double-stranded RNAs, inhibits protein translation, and induces cell apoptosis. In a previous study, we found that PC1 reduces apoptosis through suppressing the PKR/eIF2<i>&#x3b1;</i> signaling. Whether and how PKR is involved in PC1-inhibited proliferation and protein synthesis remains unknown. Here we found that knockdown of PKR abolishes PC1-inhibited proliferation and translation. Because suppressed PKR-eIF2<i>&#x3b1;</i> signaling/activity by PC1 would stimulate, rather than inhibit, the proliferation and translation, we examined the effect of dominant negative PKR mutant K296R that has no kinase activity and found that it enhances the inhibition of proliferation and translation by PC1. Thus, our study showed that inhibition of cell proliferation and protein synthesis by PC1 is mediated by the total expression but not the kinase activity of PKR, possibly through physical association.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/5320747/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:54:44.727Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:54:44.727Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552264ae9a4c4f652b3a97","title":"Medical Cannabinoids for Cancer Cachexia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","abstract":"<i>Objectives.</i> Cancer cachexia (CCA) is an intractable and ineffective metabolic syndrome that attacks 50&#x2013;80&#x25; of cancer patients.

In cattle, infection may be responsible for abortion and infertility cases causing economic losses. Humans may be contaminated through direct contact with urine of infected animals or indirectly though interaction with urine-contaminated environment. Many wildlife species living close to cattle, especially commensal rodents may play a role in the transmission of leptospires. Because little is known on the epidemiology of nonmaintenance<i> Leptospira</i> serovars, appropriate management is still limited. On a French farm where human and cattle leptospirosis were detected, the transmission cycle was explored to propose appropriate mitigation measures. For that, commensal rodents present on the farm were trapped and their leptospires carriage was studied by molecular methods. Trapped mice were shown to carry two pathogenic<i> Leptospira</i> species (<i>L. interrogans</i> and<i> L. kirschneri</i>). Since these 2 serogroups were simultaneously detected in the trapped mice and in the cows of this farm, we suspected an initial<i> Leptospira</i> transmission from mice to cows requiring an effective management of mice on this farm. Because resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides due to<i> Vkorc1</i> mutations has been largely described in rodents and first-generation anticoagulant rodenticides seemed to be inefficient in controlling mice on this farm, susceptibility of these mice to anticoagulants has been characterized by<i> Vkorc1</i> sequencing. 50&#x25; of the trapped mice carried mutations in the<i> Vkorc1</i> gene leading to severe resistance to first-generation anticoagulants. The management of such mice that are a real sanitary threat can be achieved only by using the most toxic second-generation anticoagulants or nonanticoagulant solutions.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/3794876/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:54:44.727Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:54:44.727Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552264ae9a4c4f652b3a96","title":"Identification of Potential Metabolites Mediating Bird’s Selective Feeding on Prunus mira Flowers","abstract":"In peach orchards, birds severely damage flowers during blossom season, decreasing the fruit yield potential. However, the wild peach species<i> Prunus mira</i> shows intraspecific variations of bird damage, indicating that some of the wild trees have developed strategies to avert bird foraging. Motivated by this observation, we formulated the present study to identify the potential flower metabolites mediating the bird&#x2019;s selective feeding behavior in<i> P. mira</i> flowers. The birds&#x2019; preferred (FG) and avoided (BFT) flowers were collected from wild<i> P. mira</i> trees at three different locations, and their metabolite contents were detected, quantified, and compared. The widely-targeted metabolomics approach was employed to detect a diverse set of 603 compounds, predominantly, organic acids, amino acid derivatives, nucleotide and its derivatives, and flavones. By quantitatively comparing the metabolite contents between FG and BFT, three candidate metabolites, including Eriodictiol 6-C-hexoside 8-C-hexoside-O-hexoside, Luteolin O-hexosyl-O-hexosyl-O-hexoside, and Salvianolic acid A, were differentially accumulated and showed the same pattern across the three sampling locations.

However, the mechanism of its anticancer activity remains not quite clear. In this study, we examined the inhibiting effects of Oroxylin A on breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its possible molecular mechanism. The cytoactive and inflammatory factors were analyzed via Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and ELISA assay, respectively. Flow cytometry and western blotting were used to assess the cell proliferation. In addition, a wound healing assay and transwell assay were used to detect cell invasion and migration. qRT-PCR and western blot were employed to determine the effect of Oroxylin A on the EMT formation. Moreover, expression level of protein related to NF-<i>&#x3ba;</i>B signaling pathway was determined by western blot. The results revealed that Oroxylin A attenuated the cytoactivity of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose- and a time-dependent manner. Moreover, cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of breast cancer cells were inhibited by Oroxylin A compared to the control. The mRNA and protein expression levels of E-cadherin were remarkably increased while N-cadherin and Vimentin remarkably decreased. Besides, Oroxylin A suppressed the expression of inflammatory factors and NF-<i>&#x3ba;</i>B activation. Furthermore, we also found that supplement of TNF-<i>&#x3b1;</i> reversed the effects of Oroxylin A on the cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and EMT in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggested that Oroxylin A inhibited the cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and EMT through inactivating NF-<i>&#x3ba;</i>B signaling pathway in human breast cancer cells. These findings strongly suggest that Oroxylin A could be a therapeutic potential candidate for the treatment of breast cancer.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9241769/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:00.104Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:00.104Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552274ae9a4c4f652b3a9b","title":"Uterine Radial Artery Resistance Index Predicts Reproductive Outcome in Women with Recurrent Pregnancy Losses and Thrombophilia","abstract":"Uterine radial artery resistance index (URa-RI) by Doppler ultrasound may reflect the changes in the uteroplacental circulation and be associated with adverse events in early pregnancy. Recurrent pregnancy losses (RPL) are associated with thrombophilia, and anticoagulation treatment with low molecular weight heparin improves pregnancy outcome in women with RPL and thrombophilia. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 139 pregnant women with 3 or more RPL and thrombophilia. The relationship between pregnancy outcome and dynamic changes of URa-RI was analyzed in 116 women who delivered a liveborn infant and 23 who miscarried the index pregnancy. Patients were on preconception low molecular weight heparin, low-dose aspirin (81mg per day), and prednisone treatment. URa-RI was measured during periovulation time, at the time of positive pregnancy test, and then repeated every two weeks until 32-week gestation or the time of miscarriage. The URa-RI at 8-week gestation was significantly higher in women who miscarried the index pregnancy than those who delivered alive born infant (0.51&#xb1;0.08 vs. 0.42&#xb1;0.03, P&#x3c;0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that URa-RI of 8 wk gestation effectively distinguished women who miscarried from those who had a live birth with an area under the curve of 82.6&#x25; (95&#x25; CI 69.01-97.17). After adjusting for covariates including age, BMI, and number of miscarriages, multiple logistic regression models showed that each 0.1 unit increase of URa-RI of 8 wk gestation was associated with 18.70-point increase in the risk of miscarriage (OR19.70, 95&#x25;CI 4.26-91.1, P&#x3c;0.001), and women with an URa-RI&#x2265;0.45 had an OR of 49.48 (95&#x25; CI 8.01-307.95; P&#x3c;0.001) for miscarriage compared to those who had URa-RI&#x3c;0.45. In women with RPL and inherited thrombophilia, increased URa-RI at 8-week gestation was associated with spontaneous abortion independent of other risk factors while they were on anticoagulation treatment.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8787010/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:00.104Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:00.104Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552274ae9a4c4f652b3a9c","title":"Podoplanin, a Potential Therapeutic Target for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma","abstract":"<i>Introduction</i>.

Microarray analysis was conducted to identify genes regulated by PDPN. The molecular mechanism of PDPN on NPC cells was further determined by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA).<i> Results</i>. PDPN was expressed in most TW01 NPC cells. PDPN knockdown by siRNA decreased NPC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The microarray data showed 63 upregulated genes and 12 downregulated genes following PDPN knockdown. The top 5 most upregulated genes analyzed by IPA were IFI27, IFI44L, IFI6, OAS1, and TRIM22, and the most relevant pathway was the interferon signaling pathway.<i> Conclusions</i>.

The objective of our study was to determine the variations in mechanical properties of canine femoral cortical bone with age and the mechanical anisotropy between the longitudinal and transverse directions. Twelve beagles divided into three age groups (6, 12, and 36 months) were sacrificed and all femurs were extracted. The longitudinal and transverse samples of cortical bone were harvested from three regions of diaphysis (proximal, central, and distal). A nanoindentation technique was used for simultaneously measuring force and displacement of a diamond tip pressed 2000nm into the hydrated bone tissue. An elastic modulus was calculated from the unloading curve with an assumed Poisson ratio of 0.3, while hardness was defined as the maximal force divided by the corresponding contact area. The mechanical properties of cortical bone were determined from 852 indents on two orthogonal cross-sectional surfaces. Mean elastic modulus ranged from 7.56&#xb1;0.32 GPa up to 21.56&#xb1;2.35 GPa, while mean hardness ranged from 0.28&#xb1;0.057 GPa up to 0.84&#xb1;0.072 GPa. Mechanical properties of canine femoral cortical bone tended to increase with age, but the magnitudes of these increase for each region might be different. The longitudinal mechanical properties were significantly higher than that of transverse direction (<i>P</i>&#x3c;0.01). A significant anisotropy was found in the mechanical properties while there was no significant correlation between the two orthogonal directions in each age group (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>&#x3c;0.3). Beyond that, the longitudinal mechanical properties of the distal region in each age group were lower than the proximal and central regions. Hence, mechanical properties in nanostructure of bone tissue must differ mainly among age, sample direction, anatomical sites, and individuals.

In proximal DVT, there was a greater risk of PE and sequelae venous insufficiency. After DVT, start anticoagulation. ASA 100mg/day as prophylaxis for DVT in case of this drug association in ENL is recommended.<i> Conclusion</i>. The article illustrates the incidence increase of DVT because of the thalidomide/corticosteroid combination in ENL. When this association is necessary, use ASA 100mg/day as prophylaxis.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cridm/2019/8181507/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:21.701Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:21.701Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552289ae9a4c4f652b3aa7","title":"Isoleucine Regulates the Synthesis of Pancreatic Enzymes via the Activation of mRNA Expression and Phosphorylation in the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Signalling Pathways in Pancreatic Tissues","abstract":"This study aimed to investigate the effects of isoleucine (Ile) on the synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes and cellular signalling in the pancreatic tissue of dairy goats. The pancreatic tissues were incubated in buffer containing 0, 0.40, 0.80, and 1.60&#x2009;mM Ile. High levels of Ile significantly increased the buffer release and total concentration of <i>&#x251;</i>-amylase in the tissues (P &#x3c; 0.001). The total trypsin and chymotrypsin concentrations in each of the Ile groups were significantly higher than those in the control group (P &#x3c; 0.05); however, lipase was not affected. High levels of Ile significantly increased <i>&#x251;</i>-amylase mRNA expression (P &#x3c; 0.001) but had no effect on the mRNA expression of trypsin, chymotrypsin, or lipase. Ile did not affect S6K1 phosphorylation levels. High levels of Ile significantly increased the expression of the <i>&#x3b3;</i> isoform of 4EBP1 (P &#x3c; 0.001), which indicated that the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 was significantly increased. The phosphorylation level of eEF2 gradually decreased with the addition of Ile (P &#x3c; 0.001). These results suggested that high doses of Ile can regulate the excretion of enzymes, especially <i>&#x251;</i>-amylase, in the pancreatic tissues of dairy goats by modulating mTOR signalling, and this regulation is independent of the mTOR-S6K1 pathway.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/6302950/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:21.701Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:21.701Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552289ae9a4c4f652b3aa8","title":"The Effects of Virtual Reality Training on Function in Chronic Stroke Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","abstract":"<i>Objective</i>.

Anticoagulants carry a significant risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. With the increase in use and availability of direct oral anticoagulants (&#x201c;DOACs&#x201d;) more data are available regarding the risks of these medications. With diverticular bleeds being common, and hospitalization associated with gastrointestinal bleed increasing 30-day mortality, it is paramount to better understand the potential risks of using DOACs in this population.<i> Methods</i>. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken, using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL. Two reviewers independently searched the literature, and initial screening was performed through title and abstract reading. Search terms included &#x201c;direct&#x201d; AND &#x201c;anticoagulant&#x201d; AND &#x201c;diverticular bleed&#x201d; OR &#x201c;diverticular hemorrhage&#x201d;. The references of the selected studies were manually reviewed for any further relevant articles.<i> Results</i>. Literature search across the databases garnered 182 articles&#x2014;157 unique abstracts after duplicate removal. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6 studies were deemed relevant. The selected studies&#x2019; reference lists yielded no further relevant articles.<i> Discussion</i>. Across the 6 studies, the incidence of diverticular bleeding in patients using DOACs was extremely low. Of 23,990 patients taking DOACs identified from two separate institutions, only 60 were found to have diverticular hemorrhage. Similarly, among 15,056 patients with diverticular hemorrhage, only 246 (1.6&#x25;) among them were taking DOACs. Generally, the studies found no increased diverticular bleeding rate between patients taking DOACs and those who were taking other anticoagulants, such as warfarin, or the general population. The studies also did not find an increased risk of rebleeding with DOAC continuation.<i> Conclusion</i>. The evidence suggests the risk of diverticular bleed among DOAC users is equivocal to those not taking DOACs, and the overall incidence of diverticular bleed in the DOAC population is low. As it stands, the risk of thrombotic events from not starting DOACs apparently outweighs the risk of diverticular bleed.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cjgh/2019/9851307/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:21.701Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:21.701Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552289ae9a4c4f652b3aaa","title":"Improving Outcome in Infantile Autism with Folate Receptor Autoimmunity and Nutritional Derangements: A Self-Controlled Trial","abstract":"<i>Background</i>. In contrast to multiple rare monogenetic abnormalities, a common biomarker among children with infantile autism and their parents is the discovery of serum autoantibodies directed to the folate receptor alpha (FR<i>&#x3b1;</i>) localized at blood-brain and placental barriers, impairing physiologic folate transfer to the brain and fetus. Since outcome after behavioral intervention remains poor, a trial was designed to treat folate receptor alpha (FR<i>&#x3b1;</i>) autoimmunity combined with correction of deficient nutrients due to abnormal feeding habits.<i> Methods</i>. All participants with nonsyndromic infantile autism underwent a routine protocol measuring CBC, iron, vitamins, coenzyme Q10, metals, and trace elements. Serum FR<i>&#x3b1;</i> autoantibodies were assessed in patients, their parents, and healthy controls. A self-controlled therapeutic trial treated nutritional derangements with addition of high-dose folinic acid if FR<i>&#x3b1;</i> autoantibodies tested positive. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) monitored at baseline and following 2 years of treatment was compared to the CARS of untreated autistic children serving as a reference.<i> Results</i>. In this self-controlled trial (82 children; mean age &#xb1; SD: 4.4 &#xb1; 2.3 years; male:female ratio: 4.8:1), FR<i>&#x3b1;</i> autoantibodies were found in 75.6 &#x25; of the children, 34.1 &#x25; of mothers, and 29.4 &#x25; of fathers versus 3.3 &#x25; in healthy controls. Compared to untreated patients with autism (n=84) whose CARS score remained unchanged, a 2-year treatment decreased the initial CARS score from severe (mean &#xb1; SD: 41.34 &#xb1; 6.47) to moderate or mild autism (mean &#xb1; SD: 34.35 &#xb1; 6.25; paired t-test p&#x3c;0.0001), achieving complete recovery in 17/82 children (20.7 &#x25;).

Autophagy can be either a prosurvival or a prodeath process and remains one of the most fundamental processes for cell vitality. Thus autophagy modulation is an important approach for reinforcement anticancer therapeutics. Earlier we have demonstrated that recombinant analog of human milk protein lactaptin (RL2) induced apoptosis of various cultured cancer cells and activated lipidation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). In this study we investigated whether autophagy inhibitors&#x2014;chloroquine (CQ), Ku55933 (Ku), and 3-methyladenine (3MA)&#x2014;or inducer&#x2014;rapamycin (Rap)&#x2014;can enhance cytotoxic activity of lactaptin analog in cancer cells and its anticancer activity in the mice model. Western Blot analysis revealed that RL2 induced short-term autophagy in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells at early stages of incubation and that these data were confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy of autophagosome/autophagolysosome formation. RL2 stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, autophagosomes accumulation, upregulation of ATG5 with processing of LC3I to LC3II, and downregulation of p62/sequestosome 1 (p62). We have shown that autophagy modulators, CQ, Ku, and Rap, synergistically increased cytotoxicity of RL2, and RL2 with CQ induced autophagic cell death. In addition, CQ, Ku, and Rap in combination with RL2 decreased activity of lysosomal protease Cathepsin D. More importantly, combining RL2 with CQ, we improved antitumor effect in mice. Detected synergistic cytotoxic effects of both types of autophagy regulators, inhibitors, and inducers with RL2 against cancer cells allow us to believe that these combinations can be a basis for the new anticancer approach. Finally, we suppose that CQ and Rap promoting of short-term RL2-induced autophagy interlinks with final autophagic cell death.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4087160/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:21.701Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:21.701Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552289ae9a4c4f652b3aad","title":"Potential Protective Effect of Achillea fragrantissima against Adriamycin-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Rats via an Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Pathway","abstract":"Adriamycin (Adr) is a cytotoxic anthracycline agent that is utilized to manage many types of tumors, but its clinical use is undesirable due to severe cardiotoxicity.

We aimed to perform an updated meta-analysis of the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy and safety of CCM therapy.<i> Methods</i>. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) between January 2001 and June 2018. Outcomes of interest were peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2), 6-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD), Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), HF hospitalizations, cardiac arrhythmias, pacemaker/ICD malfunctioning, all-cause hospitalizations, and mortality. Data were expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio (OR).<i> Results</i>. Four RCTs including 801 patients (CCM n = 394) were available for analysis. The mean age was 59.63 &#xb1; 0.84 years, mean ejection fraction was 29.14 &#xb1; 1.22&#x25;, and mean QRS duration was 106.23 &#xb1; 1.65 msec. Mean follow-up duration was six months. CCM was associated with improved MLWHFQ (SMD -0.69, p = 0.0008). There were no differences in HF hospitalizations (OR 0.76, p = 0.12), 6MWD (SMD 0.67, p = 0.10), arrhythmias (OR 1.40, p = 0.14), pacemaker/ICD malfunction/sensing defect (OR 2.23, p = 0.06), all-cause hospitalizations (OR 0.73, p = 0.33), or all-cause mortality (OR 1.04, p = 0.92) between the CCM and non-CCM groups.<i> Conclusions</i>. Short-term treatment with CCM may improve MLFHQ without significant difference in 6MWD, arrhythmic events, HF hospitalizations, all-cause hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality. There is a trend towards increased pacemaker/ICD device malfunction. Larger RCTs might be needed to determine if the CCM therapy will be beneficial with longer follow-up.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cdtp/2019/9769724/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:36.722Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:36.722Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552298ae9a4c4f652b3aaf","title":"Antioxidant Potential, Phytochemicals Composition, and Metal Contents of Datura alba","abstract":"This study investigated the phytochemical characteristics and antioxidant activity in leaves, roots, stem, flower, and seed parts of<i> Datura alba (D. alba). </i>The study also assessed the heavy metal (Cr, Mn, Zn, and Cu) accumulation in each part of the plant<i>. </i>Among the phytochemicals, alkaloids were found only in leaves while tannins, flavonoids, and phenols were present in all parts of the plant.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors that increase the risk of CVD. Here, we aimed to investigate the association of cystatin C with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular outcomes in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) with preserved renal function.<i> Methods.</i> In total, 422 NSTE-ACS patients with preserved renal function were enrolled to examine the association of cystatin C with MetS. MetS was defined based on the NCEP-ATP-III guidelines. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) were also evaluated, which included cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), target vessel revascularization (TVR), heart failure, and nonfatal stroke. All patients underwent a 12-month follow-up for MACEs after admission.<i> Results.</i> Cystatin C was significantly correlated with metabolic risk factors and inflammation markers. The prevalence of MetS and MACEs correlated with cystatin C levels. Cystatin C showed a strong diagnostic performance for cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes in ROC analysis. After adjustment for multiple risk factors, cystatin C level was independently associated with MetS (OR 2.299, 95&#x25; CI 1.251&#x2013;4.225, and P = 0.007). During a 12-month follow-up, the patients with high cystatin C level and MetS had higher incidence of MACEs (Log-rank = 24.586, P &#x3c; 0.001) and cardiac death (Log-rank = 9.890, P = 0.020) compared to the others. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that cystatin C level was an independent predictor of MACEs (HR 2.609, 95&#x25; CI 1.295&#x2013;5.257, and P = 0.007).<i> Conclusion.</i> Cystatin C may be an independent predictor of metabolic syndrome and therefore valuable for management of NSTE-ACS patients.

However, the clinical significance and biological effects of EYA2 in human prostate cancer remain unknown. In this study, we showed that increased levels of Eya2 protein correlated with advanced TNM stage, T stage, and a higher Gleason score. Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prostate cohort consistently revealed that Eya2 mRNA was positively correlated with a higher Gleason score, higher T stage, and positive nodal metastasis in prostate cancer. Furthermore, data from the Oncomine database showed increased levels of EYA2 mRNA expression in prostate cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. Eya2 protein expression was also higher in prostate cancer cell lines compared with a normal RWPE-1 cell line. We selected LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines for plasmid overexpression and shRNA knockdown. CCK-8, colony formation, and Matrigel invasion assays demonstrated that the overexpression of Eya2 promoted proliferation, colony number, and invasion while Eya2 shRNA inhibited proliferation rate, colony formation, and invasion ability. CCK-8 and Annexin V assays showed that Eya2 reduced sensitivity to docetaxel and docetaxel-induced apoptosis while Eya2 shRNA showed the opposite effects. The overexpression of Eya2 also downregulated the cleavage of caspase3 and PARP while Eya2 depletion upregulated caspase3 and PARP cleavage. Notably, JC-1 staining demonstrated that Eya2 upregulated mitochondrial membrane potential. We further revealed that the overexpression of Eya2 upregulated Bcl-2, matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), and AKT phosphorylation. Accordingly, data from the TCGA prostate cohort indicated that EYA2 mRNA was positively correlated with the expression of Bcl-2 and MMP7. The inhibition of AKT attenuated EYA2-induced Bcl-2 upregulation. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that Eya2 was upregulated in prostate cancers. EYA2 promotes cell proliferation and invasion as well as cancer progression by regulating docetaxel sensitivity and mitochondrial membrane potential, possibly via the AKT/Bcl-2 axis.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/3808432/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:36.722Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:36.722Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552298ae9a4c4f652b3ab2","title":"Tongxinluo Attenuates Myocardiac Fibrosis after Acute Myocardial Infarction in Rats via Inhibition of Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition","abstract":"Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is an essential mechanism in myocardial fibrosis (MF). Tongxinluo (TXL) has been confirmed to protect the endothelium against reperfusion injury after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, whether TXL can inhibit MF after AMI via inhibiting EndMT remained unknown. This study aims to identify the role of EndMT in MF after AMI as well as the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of TXL on MF. The AMI model was established in rats by ligating left anterior descending coronary artery. Then, rats were administered with high- (0.8 g&#xB7;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#xB7;d<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), mid- (0.4 g&#xB7;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#xB7;d<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), and low- (0.2 g&#xB7;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#xB7;d<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) dose Tongxinluo and benazepril for 4 weeks, respectively. Cardiac function, infarct size, MF, and related indicators of EndMT were measured. In vitro, human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs) were pretreated with TXL for 4 h and then incubated in hypoxia conditions for 3 days to induce EndMT. Under this hypoxic condition, neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) siRNA were further applied to silence NRG-1 expression. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to assess expression of endothelial marker of vWF and fibrotic marker of Vimentin. Related factors of EndMT were determined by Western blot analysis. TXL treatment significantly improved cardiac function, ameliorated MF, reduced collagen of fibrosis area (types I and III collagen) and limited excessive extracellular matrix deposition (mmp2 and mmp9). In addition, TXL inhibited EndMT in cardiac tissue and hypoxia-induced HCMECs. In hypoxia-induced HCMECs, TXL increased the expression of endothelial markers, whereas decreasing the expression of fibrotic markers, partially through enhanced expressions of NRG-1, phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB4, AKT, and downregulated expressions of hypoxia inducible factor-1a and transcription factor snail. After NRG-1 knockdown, the protective effect of TXL on HCMEC was partially abolished. In conclusion, TXL attenuates MF after AMI by inhibiting EndMT and through activating the NRG-1/ErbB- PI3K/AKT signalling cascade.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/6595437/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:36.722Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:36.722Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552298ae9a4c4f652b3ab3","title":"Elevated Blood Urea Nitrogen-to-Serum Albumin Ratio as a Factor That Negatively Affects the Mortality of Patients with Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia","abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate the factors that affect 30-day mortality of patients with HAP.

It is profound to reduce the incidence of DGF for maintaining long-term graft survival. However, the molecular regulation of DGF is still not adequately explained and the biomarkers for DGF are limited. Exosomes are cell-derived membrane vesicles, contents of which are stable and could be delivered into recipient cells to exert their biological functions. Consequently, exosome-derived proteomic and RNA signature profiles are often used to account for the molecular regulation of diseases or reflect the conditional state of their tissue as biomarkers. Few researches have been done to demonstrate the function of exosomes associated with DGF. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to explore the miRNA expression profiling of exosomes in the peripheral blood of kidney recipients with DGF. We identified 52 known and 5 conserved exosomal miRNAs specifically expressed in recipients with DGF.

After 8 weeks of regular aerobic exercise, a 6-hydroxydopamine- (6-OHDA-) induced PD lesion model was constructed. Preregular aerobic exercises enhanced the injury resistance of rats with 6-OHDA-induced PD. The rotational behavior after injection of apomorphine hydrochloride was alleviated. Under the scanning electron microscopy, we found the neurons, axons, and villi of the striatum were clearly and tightly arranged, and neurons and axons significantly becoming larger.

By comparing the BGCs of known SM between obese and nonobese samples, we found that menaquinone produced by<i> Enterobacter cloacae</i> showed the highest correlation with BMI, in agreement with a recent study on human adipose tissue composition. Furthermore, an obesity-related nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) was negatively associated with Bacteroidetes<i>, </i>indicating that the SMs produced by intestinal microbes in obese individuals can change the microbiome structure<i>.</i> This is the first systemic study of the association between gut microbiome BGCs and obesity and provides new insights into the causes of obesity.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/6361320/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:53.134Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:55:53.134Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5522a9ae9a4c4f652b3ac1","title":"Comparability of Self-Ratings and Observer Ratings in Occupational Psychosocial Risk Assessments: Is There Agreement?","abstract":"<i>Objective</i>. The suitability of self-ratings and observer ratings within organisational management approaches is controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the degree of agreement between self-rated and observer-rated occupational psychosocial demands. The comparison took place within a work-activity and not worker-centred assessment, according to official policies for psychosocial risk assessment. Through simultaneous application of two versions of the same instrument, we aimed to reduce the rating bias to a minimum demonstrating the suitability of self-ratings and observer ratings in companies of all kinds.<i> Methods</i>. A multimethod online assessment of 22 different work activities was conducted in Germany from October 2016 to October 2017. Workers (self-ratings) and occupational safety and health (OSH) committees (observer ratings) rated the occupational psychosocial risks of each activity with the same instrument (<i>N</i> = 669). The instrument measured psychosocial risk conditions at work. Reliability and agreement indices were computed.<i> Results</i>.

Despite the fact that most studies describe an anxiolytic effect of testosterone, hyperandrogenemia in mothers is assumed to be related to an increased risk of mood disorders in their offspring. An increasing body of scientific evidence suggests that an altered expression of interneuronal markers of the hippocampus may be the cause of anxiety. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of maternal hyperandrogenemia on behavioral parameters of anxiety-like behavior, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and parvalbumin (PV) expression in the hippocampus, and the level of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Pregnant female Wistar albino rats were treated with testosterone undecanoate on the 20th day of gestation. Anxiety-like behavior in adult female offspring was evaluated by the elevated plus maze test and the open field. The number of PV and NPY immunoreactive cells in the hippocampus was determined immunohistochemically. The level of BDNF expression in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was analyzed with the Western blot test. Prenatal hyperandrogenization increased anxiety-like behavior in female offspring and decreased expression of NPY+ and PV+ in the CA1 region of the hippocampus as compared to the control group.

Prenatal hyperandrogenization may be the cause of anxiety-like behavior in female offspring. Decrease in NPY and PV expression in the hippocampus may explain the possible mechanism of hyperandrogenization induced anxiety.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/3426092/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:56:23.026Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:56:23.026Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5522c7ae9a4c4f652b3acf","title":"Neutrophilic Dermatoses and Their Implication in Pathophysiology of Asthma and Other Respiratory Comorbidities: A Narrative Review","abstract":"Neutrophilic dermatoses (ND) are a polymorphous group of noncontagious dermatological disorders that share the common histological feature of a sterile cutaneous infiltration of mature neutrophils. Clinical manifestations can vary from nodules, pustules, and bulla to erosions and ulcerations. The etiopathogenesis of neutrophilic dermatoses has continuously evolved. Accumulating genetic, clinical, and histological evidence point to NDs being classified in the spectrum of autoinflammatory conditions. However, unlike the monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes where a clear multiple change in the inflammasome structure/function is demonstrated, NDs display several proinflammatory abnormalities, mainly driven by IL-1, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). Additionally, because of the frequent association with extracutaneous manifestations where neutrophils seem to play a crucial role, it was plausible also to consider NDs as a cutaneous presentation of a systemic neutrophilic condition. Neutrophilic dermatoses are more frequently recognized in association with respiratory disorders than by chance alone. The combination of the two, particularly in the context of their overlapping immune responses mediated primarily by neutrophils, raises the likelihood of a common neutrophilic systemic disease or an aberrant innate immunity disorder. Associated respiratory conditions can serve as a trigger or may develop or be exacerbated secondary to the uncontrolled skin disorder. Physicians should be aware of the possible pulmonary comorbidities and apply this knowledge in the three steps of patients&#x2019; management, work-up, diagnosis, and treatment. In this review, we attempt to unravel the pathophysiological mechanisms of this association and also present some evidence for the role of targeted therapy in the treatment of both conditions.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/7315274/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:56:23.026Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:56:23.026Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5522c7ae9a4c4f652b3ad0","title":"Neck Circumference as an Anthropometric Indicator of Central Obesity in Patients with Prediabetes: A Cross-Sectional Study","abstract":"Measurement of waist circumference has substantial variability and some limitations, while neck circumference is a simple and reliable anthropometric measure. This study aimed to assess the association between neck circumference and waist circumference and to identify the best cutoff of neck circumference that could predict central obesity in prediabetic patients. This cross-sectional study included adult patients with prediabetes, defined as having fasting plasma glucose levels ranging from 100 to 125&#x2009;mg/dL or HbA1c ranging from 5.7 to 6.49&#x25;, who visited the outpatient clinic of Family Medicine Department, Ramathibodi Hospital, Thailand, during October 2014 and March 2016. Neck circumference was measured from the level just below the laryngeal prominence perpendicular to the long axis of the neck. Central obesity was defined as having waist circumference measurements greater than 90 and 80&#x2009;cm for males and females, respectively. The correlation between neck circumference and waist circumference was explored by applying pairwise correlation coefficient. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed and Youden index equal to &#x201c;sensitivity &#x2013; (1-specificity)&#x201d; was calculated. Neck circumference that yielded the maximum Youden index was determined as the optimal cutoff point for prediction of central obesity. There were 1,534 patients eligible for this study. After adjusting for covariables, neck circumference was found to be significantly associated with waist circumference in both females and males, with <i>&#x3b2;</i>-coefficients of 1.01 (95&#x25; CI: 0.83, 1.20) and 0.65 (95&#x25; CI: 0.46, 0.85), respectively. After applying the ROC analysis, neck circumferences &#x2265; 32&#x2009;cm in females and &#x2265; 38&#x2009;cm in males were determined as the best cutoff values to predict central obesity. Neck circumference is strongly correlated with waist circumference in prediabetics and should be considered as an alternative to the waist circumference measurement in screening for central obesity.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4808541/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:56:23.026Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:56:23.026Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5522c7ae9a4c4f652b3ad3","title":"Analysis of Potential Genes and Pathways Involved in the Pathogenesis of Acne by Bioinformatics","abstract":"Acne is the eighth most frequent disease worldwide.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were filtered and subjected to functional and pathway enrichment analyses. Protein&#x2013;protein interaction (PPI) network and module analyses were also performed based on the DEGs. In this work, 154 common DEGs, including 145 upregulated and 9 downregulated, were obtained from two microarray profiles. Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment of DEGs were clustered using significant enrichment analysis. A PPI network containing 110 nodes/DEGs was constructed, and 31 hub genes were obtained. Four modules in the PPI network, which mainly participated in chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine&#x2013;cytokine receptor interaction, and Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, were extracted.

Decreased organ function following liver resection is a major clinical issue. The practical method of ischemic postconditioning (IPostC) has been studied in heart diseases, but no data exist regarding fibrotic livers.<i> Aims</i>. We aimed to determine whether IPostC could protect healthy, fibrotic, and cirrhotic livers from ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI).<i> Methods</i>. Fibrosis was induced in male SD rats using bile duct ligation (BDL, 4 weeks), and cirrhosis was induced using thioacetamide (TAA, 18 weeks). Fibrosis and cirrhosis were histologically confirmed using HE and EvG staining. For healthy, fibrotic, and cirrhotic livers, isolated liver perfusion with 90 min of warm ischemia was performed in three groups (each with n=8): control, IPostC 8x20 sec, and IPostC 4x60 sec. additionally, healthy livers were investigated during a follow-up study. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and thromboxane B<sub>2</sub> (TXB<sub>2</sub>) in the perfusate, as well as bile flow (healthy/TAA) and portal perfusion pressure, were measured.<i> Results</i>. LDH and TXB<sub>2</sub> were reduced, and bile flow was increased by IPostC, mainly in total and in the late phase of reperfusion. The follow-up study showed that the perfusate derived from a postconditioned group had much less damaging potential than perfusate derived from the nonpostconditioned group.<i> Conclusion</i>. IPostC following warm ischemia protects healthy, fibrotic, and cirrhotic livers against IRI. Reduced efflux of TXB<sub>2</sub> is one possible mechanism for this effect of IPostC and increases sinusoidal microcirculation. These findings may help to improve organ function and recovery of patients after liver resection.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cjgh/2019/5683479/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:56:23.026Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:56:23.026Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5522c7ae9a4c4f652b3ad1","title":"Mitral Valve Endocarditis with Perforation from a Urinary Source: An Unusual Case and Literature Review","abstract":"<i>Aerococcus urinae</i> (AU) is a rare pathogen, identified as gram-positive, catalase-negative coccus that grows in pairs and clusters which has been reported to mainly cause urinary tract infections (UTI), especially in elderly males.

Little is known about the possible relationship between genes modulating Extra-Cellular Matrix (ECM) and AE etiopathogenesis. In this regard, the primary objective of the present study has been the investigation of susceptibility biomarkers localized within genes encoding collagen proteins. Several studies have shown that polymorphisms within the genes encoding such proteins may generate abnormal connective tissues, making them more susceptible to mechanical stress, loss of epidermal integrity, and aging. We therefore decided to investigate three polymorphisms located in<i> COL6A5, COL8A1</i>, and<i> COL10A1</i> as potential susceptibility biomarkers for AE in a cohort of 1470 subjects of Mediterranean origin. The genes of interest have been selected considering that the ECM and immune/inflammatory response are strongly dysregulated in AE and other complex disorders. The study confirmed that the susceptibility to AE depends on a complex interaction between latitude, geographical localization, and the differential distribution of genetic variants among populations exposed to similar environmental factors.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/3457898/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:56:37.964Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:56:37.964Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5522d5ae9a4c4f652b3adf","title":"Effects of Minimal Extracorporeal Circulation on the Systemic Inflammatory Response and the Need for Transfusion after Coronary Bypass Grafting Surgery","abstract":"<i>Objectives</i>.

Perioperative markers of inflammation after cardiopulmonary bypass in both groups were tested by measuring the levels via chemiluminescent immunometric assay. Blood samples were taken consecutively after anesthesia induction, 30<sup>th</sup> minute of CPB, on the 6<sup>th</sup>, 24<sup>th</sup>, and 48<sup>th</sup> hours after cardiopulmonary bypass. <i>Results</i>. The mean amount of priming solution was significantly lower in Group M when compared to Group C (802.60 ± 48.26 and 1603.71 ± 49.85 ml). The mean hematocrit (Hct) value taken immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass was found to be significantly higher in the MiECT patients with respect to the other group (% 32.71 ± 3.98 and % 28.82 ± 4.39). The transfused amounts of erythrocyte suspension and fresh frozen plasma were found to be significantly lower in patients in Group M when compared to those in Group C. Postoperative mediastinal drainage was also significantly lower in patients in Group M with respect to the other group. There was no significant difference between markers of inflammation. <i>Conclusion</i>. Our results show that MiECT seems to be more advantageous in terms of priming volume, perioperative hematocrit levels, need for blood and blood product transfusion, and mediastinal drainage with respect to the conventional approach after coronary artery bypass grafting.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crp/2019/1726150/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:56:37.964Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:56:37.964Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5522e8ae9a4c4f652b3ae1","title":"Laser Therapy in the Treatment of Female Urinary Incontinence and Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause: An Update","abstract":"Vaginal birth trauma is the leading cause of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women.

Food safety practice is an important Public Health issue to prevent or control food-borne illnesses. Evidence shows that 10 to 20&#x25; of food-borne diseases outbreaks are because of contamination by food handlers in restaurants, butcher shops, markets, etc. However, the food safety practice and associated factors among mothers who are the food handlers at their homes are not well studied and understood. This study aimed to assess food safety practice and associated factors among mothers in Debarq town.<i> Methods</i>. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted during March and April, 2018. Four hundred and twenty-three study participants were included using simple random sampling techniques. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with food safety practice based on AOR with 95&#x25; CI and p &#x3c; 0.05.<i> Results</i>. About 210 (49.6&#x25;) of study participants had good food safety practice.

New paradigms are emerging including preservation at higher temperature than &#x201c;hypothermia&#x201d; or &#x201c;cold&#x201d;: although 4&#xb0;C remains largely used for kidney preservation, recent studies challenged this choice. We and others hypothesized that a higher preservation temperature, closer to physiological regimen, could improve organ quality. For this purpose, we used an<i> in vitro</i> model of endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia-reoxygenation sequence (mimicking IR) and an<i> ex vivo</i> ischemic pig kidneys static storage model.<i> In vitro</i>, 19&#xb0;C, 27&#xb0;C, and 32&#xb0;C provided protection against injuries versus 4&#xb0;C, by reducing cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction, leukocyte adhesion, and inflammation.

Epidemiological and genetic studies of humans and animals provide strong evidence of a causal relationship between high salt intake and hypertension.

If conversion of labor epidural analgesia to cesarean delivery anesthesia fails, the anesthesiologist can be confronted with a challenging clinical dilemma. Optimal management of a failed epidural top up continues to be debated in the absence of best practice guidelines. <i>Method</i>. All members of the Obstetric Anaesthetists&#x2019; Association in the United Kingdom were emailed an online survey in May 2017. It obtained information on factors influencing the decision to utilize an existing labor epidural for cesarean section and, if epidural top up resulted in no objective sensory block, bilateral T10 sensory block, or unilateral T6 sensory block, factors influencing the management and selection of anesthetic technique. Differences in management options between respondents were compared using the chi-squared test. <i>Results</i>. We received 710 survey questionnaires with an overall response rate of 41&#x0025;. Most respondents (89&#x0025;) would consider topping up an existing labor epidural for a category-one cesarean section. In evaluating whether or not to top up an existing labor epidural, the factors influencing decision-making were how effective the epidural had been for labor pain (99&#x0025;), category of cesarean section (73&#x0025;), and dermatomal level of blockade (61&#x0025;). In the setting of a failed epidural top up, the most influential factors determining further anesthetic management were the category of cesarean section (92&#x0025;), dermatomal level of blockade (78&#x0025;), and the assessment of maternal airway.

We used clinical tissues and OSCC cell lines and induced CDDP resistance in OSCC cells. Gain and loss of function were performed in OSCC-resistant cells. Xenograft mice were also established. HOXA11-AS expression was increased in OSCC clinical tissues and cell lines and upregulated in CDDP-resistant cells. Upregulation of HOXA11-AS promoted proliferation in CDDP-sensitive cells and inhibited CDDP-induced cytotoxicity. In contrast, downregulation of HOXA11-AS decreased proliferation in CDDP-resistant cells and increased CDDP-induced cytotoxicity. Knockdown of HOXA11-AS inhibited the tumor growth in xenograft mice injected by CDDP. Downregulation of HOXA11-AS increased apoptosis and caspase 3 activities in CDDP-resistant OSCC cells. Bioinformatics, reporter assay, and loss and gain of function assay indicated that HOXA11-AS and miR-214-3p could negatively regulate each other. miR-214-3p was decreased in OSCC clinical tissues and cell lines.

The incidence of violent behaviour towards healthcare workers is increasing worldwide. It is difficult to assess the extent of the problem, however, as violent incidents are underreported. In fact, many doctors and nurses see violence&#x2014;perpetrated primarily by patients and visitors (friends and relatives of patients)&#x2014;as a part of their job. Several studies indicate that violent behaviour against healthcare workers has serious consequences for the professionals involved, as well as for the wider healthcare system. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of patient and visitor violence in a number of emergency departments in northeastern Italy and to explore the relationship between violence and certain psychosocial factors (adult attachment style, age, and job satisfaction). Data were collected using an online questionnaire. Our results demonstrate that patient and visitor violence in emergency departments is a serious risk for nurses and doctors and that it is affected by several factors relating to both patient pathologies and the way the workplace and work patterns are organised. Previous studies indicate that the most common form of violence experienced in these contexts is emotional violence and that nurses are more likely than doctors to suffer emotional and physical violence. Based on multiple regression analysis of the data, it appears that greater age and higher scores in secure attachment are associated with reduced experience of emotional violence from patients and visitors. Furthermore, our results show that the relationship between secure attachment and the amount of patient-and-visitor-perpetrated emotional violence experienced is mediated by levels of job satisfaction. We also discuss the potential implications of these results in terms of using staff training to prevent and manage patient and visitor violence and improve the safety of healthcare professionals.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/5430870/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:57:33.958Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:57:33.958Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55230dae9a4c4f652b3afc","title":"Value of the Ratio of Monocytes to Lymphocytes for Monitoring Tuberculosis Therapy","abstract":"<i>Objective</i>.

However, accumulating evidence suggests that, apart from pain signalling, TRPV1 subserves many other unrelated to nociception functions in the nervous system. In the brain, TRPV1 can modulate synaptic transmission via both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms and there is a functional crosstalk between GABA receptors and TRPV1. Other fundamental processes include TRPV1 role in plasticity, microglia-to-neuron communication, and brain development. Moreover, TRPV1 is widely expressed in the peripheral tissues, including the vasculature, gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, epithelial cells, and the cells of the immune system. TRPV1 can be activated by a large array of physical (heat, mechanical stimuli) and chemical factors (e.g., protons, capsaicin, resiniferatoxin, and endogenous ligands, such as endovanilloids). This causes two general cell effects, membrane depolarization and calcium influx, thus triggering depending on the cell-type diverse functional responses ranging from neuronal excitation to secretion and smooth muscle contraction.

The mouse monocyte/macrophage cell line J774A.1 was used in vitro. M1 macrophages were treated with montelukast, and gene expressions of inflammatory cytokines were measured. Macrophages were cultured with montelukast, then gene expressions of arginase-1 and IL (interleukin)-10 were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, arginase-1 was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and IL-10 concentration was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In vivo, one group (Mont, n=7) received oral montelukast (10 mg/kg/day) for 28 days, and the other group (Saline, n=7) was given normal Saline as a control for the same period.

In this study, we reported a newly isolated bacterium identified as<i> Acinetobacter radioresistens</i> sp. NS-MIE from Malaysian agricultural soil. The chromate reduction potential of strain NS-MIE was optimized using RSM and ANN techniques. The optimum condition predicted by RSM for the bacterium to reduce hexavalent chromium occurred at pH 6, 10 g/L ppm of nutrient broth (NB) concentration and 100 ppm of chromate concentration while the optimum condition predicted by ANN is at pH 6 and 10 g/L of NB concentration and of 60 ppm of chromate concentration with chromate reduction (&#x25;) of 75.13 &#x25; and 96.27 &#x25;, respectively.

The distance between the modiolus and the electrode array is one factor that has become the focus of many discussions and studies. Positioning the electrode array closer to the spiral ganglion with the goal of reducing the current spread has been shown to improve hearing outcomes. The perimodiolar electrode arrays can be complemented with a surgical manoeuvre called the pull-back technique. This study focuses its attention on the recently developed 532 slim modiolar electrode.<i> Objective</i>. To investigate the intracochlear movements and pull-back technique for the 532 slim modiolar electrode.<i> Material and Methods</i>. A decapping procedure of the cochlea was performed on 5 temporal bones. The electrode array was inserted, and the intracochlear movements were microscopically examined and digitally captured. Three situations were analysed: the initial insertion, the overinsertion, and the pull-back position. The position of the three white markers of the electrode array in relation to the round window (RW) was evaluated while performing these three actions.<i> Results</i>. The initial insertion achieved an acceptable perimodiolar position of the electrode array, but a gap was still observed between the mid-portion of the array and the modiolus (the first white marker was seen in the RW). When we inserted the electrode more deeply, the mid-portion of the array was pushed away from the modiolus (the second and third white markers were seen in the RW). After applying the pull-back technique, the gap observed during the initial insertion disappeared, resulting in an optimal perimodiolar position (the first white marker was once again visible in the RW).<i> Conclusion</i>. This temporal bone study demonstrated that when applying the pull-back technique for the 532 slim modiolar electrode, a closer proximity to the modiolus was achieved when the first white marker of the electrode array was visible in the round window.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/6917084/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:57:48.168Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:57:48.168Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55231cae9a4c4f652b3b04","title":"Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation Prevents Chemotherapy-Induced Ovarian Failure via the NGF/TrkA Pathway in Rats","abstract":"Chemotherapy leads to a loss of fertility and reproductive endocrine function, thereby increasing the risk of premature ovarian failure (POF).

In the present study, the effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UCMSC) transplantation on ovarian function after ovarian damage caused by chemotherapy and the mechanism underlying these effects were investigated. POF model rats were obtained by the intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide, and cultured UCMSCs were transplanted by tail vein injection. Serum estrogen, follicle-stimulating hormone, gonadotropin releasing hormone, and anti-Mullerian hormone levels were detected by ELISA. Folliculogenesis was evaluated by histopathological examination. The expression levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), high affinity nerve growth factor receptor (TrkA), follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), and caspase-3 were evaluated by western blotting and RT-qPCR. The natural reproductive capacity was assessed by pregnant rate and numbers of embryos. The results indicated that UCMSC transplantation recovered disturbed hormone secretion and folliculogenesis in POF rats. NGF and TrkA levels increased, while FSHR and caspase-3 decreased. The pregnancy rate of POF rats was improved.

The main aim of the study was to assess youth-friendly service quality and associated factors at public health facilities in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia.<i> Methods</i>. Facility-based quantitative cross-sectional study supplemented with the qualitative design was conducted from September to December 2017 at two public health centers in Arba Minch town. Sample sizes of 403 young clients were included in the study using a systematic sampling technique. Data was collected by using an interview-administered questionnaire and observation checklist. Quantitative data analysis was made using SPSS version 20.0 to identify the association between the dependent and independent variables. Qualitative findings were coded and analyzed by using content analysis in Microsoft Excel. Finally, results are presented using narrations, tables, and figures.<i> Results</i>. A total of 403 youth-friendly service clients participated in the study.

Cervical cancer is one of the major noncommunicable public health problems among the female population affecting not only the women but also the whole community. Annually, more than half a million new patients are diagnosed with it and over 270,000 deaths occur worldwide. There are very few research efforts conducted on prevalence and associated factors of specific target group in the region. So, this study tries to show the magnitude on all women screened for precervical cancer and serves as a secondary data for other research.<i> Objective</i>. The aim of the study was to assess magnitude of precervical cancer and associated factors among screened women in Arba Minch town and zuria woreda health institutions, southern Ethiopia.<i> Methods</i>. A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted in three health facilities at Arba Minch town and zuria woreda, southern Ethiopia, from June 2015 to June 2017. Data were collected by two nurses that are working in the area of expertise and one health officer as supervisor. Data of 528 screened clients were entered into Epi data version 3.1 using checklist, double data entry verification done and exported to SPSS version 20.0. After cleaning the data, descriptive analysis was done and multivariable logistic regression model was employed to identify predictors of precervical cancer. Finally, statistical significance was declared at P &#x3c; 0.05.<i> Result</i>. In this study, the magnitude of precervical cancer is 27.7&#x25; [95&#x25;CI] (24.1-31.4)].

The magnitude of precervical cancer is 27.7&#x25; as shown in the result of the present study. Level of education, age at first sexual intercourse, history of smoking, and number of sexual partners were predictors of precervical cancer in this study.

Thus, improvement of stance stability could play an important role in fall prevention. This study aimed to determine whether high-frequency proprioceptive training (HPT) could significantly improve single stance stability (SSS) in older adults, by increasing proprioceptive control and optimizing the contribution of vision. Sixty-one subjects (30 men, 31 women) aged 65-85 years were investigated. The subjects were randomly assigned to three intervention groups, i.e., HPT, treadmill, and no intervention, stratifying by gender and proprioceptive control at baseline. Stability tests and HPT, consisting of 12 sessions (6 weeks), were performed with computerized postural stations. Pre-post analysis showed that HPT significantly improved SSS by increasing proprioceptive control (p&#x3c;0.001) and postural control (p&#x3c;0.01). The treadmill and no intervention groups did not show any significant change. The results showed that different levels of proprioceptive control may activate, inhibit, or minimize the stabilizing intervention of vision. Given that HPT significantly reduced ankle sprains and low back pain in professional athletes (previous study), we discuss the hypothesis that the risk of falls in older adults and the risk of recurrent injuries in athletes would have a common origin: lack of proprioceptive control consequent to reduced interaction with uneven ground. The findings suggest that HPT may be a powerful activator of refined proprioceptive control, which allows increased SSS, safer interaction with the ground, and mitigation of other risk factors.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/2382747/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:58:03.067Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:58:03.067Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55232bae9a4c4f652b3b0f","title":"Alteration of the Gut Microbiota and Its Effect on AMPK/NADPH Oxidase Signaling Pathway in 2K1C Rats","abstract":"<i>Background</i>.

KCC2 is encoded by the fifth member of the solute carrier 12 family (<i>SLC12A5) </i>and has remained a poorly understood component in the development and severity of many neurological diseases for many years. Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing and specific gene targeting, however, have indicated that loss of KCC2 activity is involved in a number of diseases including epilepsy and schizophrenia. It has also been implicated in neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury. Any variant of<i> SLC12A5</i> that negatively regulates the transporter’s expression may, therefore, be implicated in neurological disease. A recent whole exome study has discovered several causative mutations in patients with epilepsy. Here, we discuss the implications of KCC2 in neurological disease and consider the evolving evidence for KCC2’s potential as a therapeutic target.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8941046/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:58:03.067Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:58:03.067Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552339ae9a4c4f652b3b13","title":"Transient Asystole after Sugammadex Administration for Immediate Reversal of Deep Blockade while on Dexmedetomidine Infusion in a Super Obese Patient","abstract":"Sugammadex is increasingly used to reverse aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agents.

In this study, a triptolide-loaded exosomes delivery system (TP-Exos) was constructed and its effects on the proliferation and apoptosis of SKOV3 cells<i> in vitro </i>and<i> in vivo </i>were observed. SKOV3-exosomes (SK-Exos) were collected by ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration centrifugation. TP-Exos was constructed by sonication and ultrafiltration centrifugation. SK-Exos and TP-Exos were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, western blotting, nanoparticle-tracking analysis, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Cellular uptake of exosomes, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) cell proliferation assay, and cell apoptosis experiment were used to study the effect of TP-Exos on ovarian cancer in vitro. Tumor-targeting study of exosomes, monitoring the tumor volume of mice, and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End labeling (TUNEL) assay were used to evaluate the effect of TP-Exos on ovarian cancer in vivo. The toxicity of TP-Exos in vivo was evaluated by liver and kidney function and histopathology of major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and ovary). The results revealed that TP-Exos not only have the general characteristics of exosomes but also have high drug encapsulation efficiency. Besides, PKH26 labeled exosomes (PKH26-Exos) could be uptaken by SKOV3 cells, and Dir labeled exosomes (Dir-Exos) could be enriched to the tumor site of tumor bearing mice. Furthermore, the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on SKOV3 cells of TP-Exos were weaker than those of free TP, and tumor cell proliferation inhibition and tumor growth inhibition were stronger than that of free TP. Moreover, TP-Exos have toxic effect on liver and spleen. In conclusion, the TP-Exos could be a promising strategy for ovarian cancer, but they need to be further optimized to attenuate the damage to liver and spleen.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/2595801/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:58:17.175Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:58:17.175Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552339ae9a4c4f652b3b14","title":"PPIA, HPRT1, and YWHAZ Genes Are Suitable for Normalization of mRNA Expression in Long-Term Expanded Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells","abstract":"Long-term expansion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under defined culture conditions is necessary in human stem cell therapy. However, it alters the characteristics of MSCs. Since quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is widely used as one of the key analytical methods for comparative characterization, the validation of reference genes (RGs) for normalization under each experimental condition is important to achieve reliable qRT-PCR results. Therefore, the most stable RGs for long-term expanded bone marrow- and umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs and UCB-MSCs) under defined culture conditions for up to 20 passages were evaluated. The more apparent alterations in characteristics such as differentiation capacity, proliferation, senescence, and the expression of RGs were noted in BM-MSCs than UCB-MSCs during long-term expansion. The RG validation programs (GeNorm and NormFinder) suggested that PPIA, HPRT1, and YWHAZ were suitable for normalization in qRT-PCR regardless of MSC types and long-term culture expansion, and the traditional RGs (ACTB and GAPDH) were less stable in long-term expanded MSCs. In addition, the use of these RGs for normalization of OCT4 expression in long-term expanded BM-MSCs showed that a less stable RG (GAPDH) showed contrasting data compared to other RGs. Therefore, the use of RGs such as PPIA, HPRT1, and YWHAZ for normalization in qRT-PCR experiments is highly recommended for long-term expanded MSCs to generate accurate and reliable data.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/3093545/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:58:17.175Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:58:17.175Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552339ae9a4c4f652b3b16","title":"In Vitro Cytotoxicity of Self-Adhesive Dual-Cured Resin Cement Polymerized Beneath Three Different Cusp Inclinations of Zirconia","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the<i> in vitro</i> cytotoxicity of self-adhesive dual-cured resin cement (SADRC) polymerized beneath three different cusp inclinations of zirconia with different light curing time.

Patients with severe AAV showed higher frequencies of general and renal manifestations, along with ANCA positivity, and exhibited a higher mean neutrophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein levels, but lower mean haemoglobin and serum albumin levels than those with nonsevere AAV. The mean serum AIMP1 level in patients with severe AAV was significantly higher than that of patients with nonsevere AIMP1 (351.1 vs. 98.4 pg/mL, p = 0.006). Multivariate logistic regression analysis including variables showing significance in univariate analyses revealed that only serum AIMP1 exhibited a significant association with severe AAV (odds ratio 1.004, p = 0.031).

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by Uropathogenic<i> Escherichia coli</i> (UPEC) are among the most common infections worldwide, including Romania. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study performed on a significant number of community-acquired (CA) UPEC strains isolated from Romanian outpatients, aiming to evaluate and establish potential correlations among the phylogenetic groups (PG), resistance profiles, and the virulence factors (VF) genes of the CA-UPEC isolates.<i> Materials/Methods</i>. The present study was performed on a total of 787 UPEC nonrepetitive isolates consecutively isolated during one month from outpatients with CA-UTIs, visiting one of the biggest laboratories in Bucharest, Romania, receiving patients from all over the country. The strains identification was performed by MALDI TOF and the susceptibility patterns were tested using Microscan according to CLSI guidelines.

Despite the fact that there are many methods to treat HCC, the 5-year survival rate of HCC is still at a low level. Emodin can inhibit the growth of HCC cells in<i> vitro</i> and in<i> vivo</i>. However, the gene regulation of emodin in HCC has not been well studied. In our research, RNA sequencing technology was used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HepG2 cells induced by emodin. A total of 859 DEGs were identified, including 712 downregulated genes and 147 upregulated genes in HepG2 cells treated with emodin. We used DAVID for function and pathway enrichment analysis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING, and Cytoscape was used for module analysis. The enriched functions and pathways of the DEGs include positive regulation of apoptotic process, structural molecule activity and lipopolysaccharide binding, protein digestion and absorption, ECM-receptor interaction, complement and coagulation cascades, and MAPK signaling pathway. 25 hub genes were identified and pathway analysis revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in neuropeptide signaling pathway, inflammatory response, and positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration. Survival analysis showed that LPAR6, C5, SSTR5, GPR68, and P2RY4 may be involved in the molecular mechanisms of emodin therapy for HCC. A quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay showed that the mRNA levels of LPAR6, C5, SSTR5, GPR68, and P2RY4 were significantly decreased in HepG2 cells treated with emodin. In conclusion, the identified DEGs and hub genes in the present study provide new clues for further researches on the molecular mechanisms of emodin.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/3065818/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:58:34.554Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:58:34.554Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55234aae9a4c4f652b3b1d","title":"Agent-Based Modeling of Employee Protection-Oriented Safety Proactivity Behaviors at Small Scale Enterprises","abstract":"Although the safety production level at small scale enterprises is important for business success, critical safety interactions among the enterprises, its employees, the public, and the government have not been explained well in the literature.

Therefore, it could be valuable for the detection of CIAV contamination in vaccines.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/2750472/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:58:34.555Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:58:34.555Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55234aae9a4c4f652b3b24","title":"mTORC2 Regulates Lipogenic Gene Expression through PPARγ to Control Lipid Synthesis in Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells","abstract":"The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) primarily functions as an effector of insulin/PI3K signaling to regulate cell proliferation and is associated with cell metabolism. However, the function of mTORC2 in lipid metabolism is not well understood. In the present study, mTORC2 was inactivated by the ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 or shRNA targeting<i> RICTOR</i> in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (pBMECs). MTT assay was performed to examine the effect of AZD8055 on cell proliferation. ELISA assay and GC-MS analysis were used to determine the content of lipid. The mRNA and protein expression levels were investigated by RT/real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. We found that cell proliferation, mTORC2 activation, and lipid secretion were inhibited by AZD8055.<i> RICTOR</i> was knocked down and mTORC2 activation was specifically attenuated by the shRNA. Compared to control cells, the expression of the transcription factor gene<i> PPARG</i> and the lipogenic genes<i> LPIN1</i>,<i> DGAT1</i>,<i> ACACA</i>, and<i> FASN</i> was downregulated in<i> RICTOR</i> silencing cells. As a result, the content of intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG), palmitic acid (PA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and other 16 types of fatty acid was decreased in the treated cells; the accumulation of TAG, PA, and DHA in cell culture medium was also reduced. Overall, mTORC2 plays a critical role in regulating lipogenic gene expression, lipid synthesis, and secretion in pBMECs, and this process probably is through PPAR<i>&#x3b3;</i>.

We recently performed an Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) study in Behcet&#x2019;s disease (BD) and identified various cytosine&#x2013;phosphate&#x2013;guanine (CpG) loci that were aberrantly methylated. In the current study, we wanted to investigate whether these sites contained genetic polymorphisms and whether the frequency of these polymorphisms was altered in BD.<i> Methods</i>. A two-stage study was performed. The first stage involved 358 BD patients and 704 healthy controls to investigate genetic variants of 10 CpG-SNPs (rs10454134, rs176249, rs3808620, rs10176517, rs11247118, rs78016579, rs9461624, rs10492166, rs34929465, and rs6507921) using an iPLEX Gold genotyping assay and a Sequenom MassARRAY.

As vertebrate insectivores, lizards protect plants from herbivorous insects increasing plant biomass via the trophic cascade and represent an important link between invertebrates and higher predators. A negative effect of glyphosate on lizards&#x2019; survival could have major impacts at the ecological levels. In this study, we investigated the effects of the exposure to low doses of glyphosate on the liver of the wall lizard<i> Podarcis siculus,</i> a suitable bioindicator of soil pollution. Two different doses of pure glyphosate (0.05 and 0.5 <i>&#x3bc;</i>g/kg body weight) were orally administered every other day for 3 weeks to sexually mature males and females. The results demonstrated that both doses, despite being very low, are toxic for the liver that showed clear signs of suffering, regardless of sex.

To explore the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of Chiari malformation type I (CMI) in patients with dysphagia.<i> Methods</i>. Adult patients diagnosed with CMI were retrospectively and consecutively reviewed from January 2013 to December 2016. Symptoms and medical characteristics were recorded. According to the clinical manifestations, we divided the patients into two groups. The first group had 21 patients with symptoms of dysphagia and the second group had 71 patients with nondysphagia symptoms. Various length or angle measurements of the posterior cranial fossa (PCF), syringomyelia, and degree of cerebellar tonsillar herniation were investigated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Univariate, correlation, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to compare and analyze the data of the two groups.<i> Results</i>. The mean length of the clivus, height of PCF, and slope inclination angle of clivus significantly decreased in the dysphagia group compared to the nondysphagia group. The mean cranial spinal angle (CSA) and degree of cerebellar tonsillar herniation were significantly larger in the dysphagia group. There were no correlations between the age, sex, disease duration, and the length of cerebellar tonsillar herniation or CSA. There was a positive correlation between dysphagia level and CSA (r=-0.50; p=0.021). Among CSA, age, sex, the degree of tonsillar herniation, syringomyelia, and disease duration, CSA was the individual sign that correlated significantly with dysphagia (OR: 1.447; 95&#x25; CI: 1.182-1.698; P&#x3c;0.001). Interactions between CSA and the degree of cerebellar tonsillar herniation, syringomyelia, and dysphagia existed (OR: 1.104; 95&#x25; CI: 1.042-1.170; P=0.001 and OR: 1.081; 95&#x25; CI: 1.023-1.142; P=0.006, respectively).<i> Conclusions</i>. The CMI patients with dysphagia were more likely to have a large CSA on MRI compared with CMI patients without dysphagia. An increased probability with syringomyelia or length of cerebellar tonsillar herniation can enhance the contribution of CSA to dysphagia in patients with CMI.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/7485010/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:59:03.480Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:59:03.480Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552367ae9a4c4f652b3b32","title":"Pharmacological Protection of Kidney Grafts from Cold Perfusion-Induced Injury","abstract":"One of the greatest challenges facing the field of organ transplantation is the shortage of donor organs for transplantation. Renal transplantation increases quality of life and survival of patients suffering from end-stage renal disease. Although kidney transplantation has evolved greatly over the past few decades, a not insignificant amount of injury occurs to the kidney during recovery, preservation, and implantation and leads to the loss of function and loss of years of dialysis-free living for many patients. The use of kidneys from expanded criteria donors (ECD) and donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) has been adopted partly in response to the shortage of donor kidneys; however these kidneys are even more susceptible to ischemic injury. It has been shown that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in mechanisms of injury to the transplant kidney. There is also some evidence that inhibition of MMP activity and/or ROS production can protect the kidney from injury.

In this trial, we examined the hypothesis that a continuous thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) administered through a catheter inserted into the anterior region of the TPVS allows a wider sensory block dispersion. Fifty consecutive patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery were enrolled. Before the surgery, an infusion catheter was inserted into the TPVS through a needle placed adjacent to either the parietal pleura (group A) or internal intercostal membrane (group P) using an ultrasound-guided intercostal transverse approach according to a randomized allocation schedule. A chest radiograph was obtained postoperatively after injection of 10 mL of radiopaque dye through the catheter. Thereafter, 20 mL of 0.375&#x25; levobupivacaine was injected via the catheter, followed by commencement of continuous TPVB with 0.25&#x25; levobupivacaine at 8 mL/h. The primary outcome was the number of blocked dermatomes at 24 h after surgery. The secondary outcomes included radiopaque dye spreading patterns, the number of segments reached by the radiopaque dye, the number of blocked dermatomes at 2 h after surgery, and pain scores. The median (interquartile range [range]) number of blocked dermatomes 24 h after surgery was 3 (2.75&#x2013;4 [1&#x2013;6]) in group A (n = 22) and 2 (1.5&#x2013;3 [0&#x2013;7]) in group P (n = 25; p = 0.037).

Therefore, the accuracy of prediction model can be improved by integrating gene expression profile data and clinical data. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end model, Attention-based Multi-NMF DNN (AMND), which combines clinical data and gene expression data extracted by Multiple Nonnegative Matrix Factorization algorithms (Multi-NMF) for the prognostic prediction of breast cancer. The innovation of this method is highlighted through using clinical data and combining multiple feature selection methods with the help of Attention mechanism. The results of comprehensive performance evaluation show that the proposed model reports better predictive performances than either models only using data of single modality, e.g., gene or clinical, or models based on any single NMF improved methods which only use one of the NMF algorithms to extract features. The performance of our model is competitive or even better than other previously reported models.

The most important factor that regulates the access of endogenous glucocorticoids to receptors after release of glucocorticoids and their diffusion into the cytoplasm of target cells is the steroid metabolism involving a microsomal enzyme, 11<i>&#x3b2;</i>-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11<i>&#x3b2;</i>-HSD).

The purpose of this study was to conduct a retrospective evaluation of a new TACE technique called the repeated alternate infusion of cisplatin solution and gelatin slurry distal to balloon occlusion (RAIB-TACE), for the treatment of small HCC nodules adjacent to GS.<i> Materials and Methods.</i> Small nodules less than 4 cm attached to proximal portion of the subsegmental to lobar level portal branch were retrospectively selected. Between January 2011 and April 2014, 29 nodules in 29 patients were treated by super-selective lipiodol TACE/balloon-occluded TACE (B-TACE) (Lip-TACE group). Since April 2014, treatment protocols for small nodules adjacent to GS were changed, and 14 nodules in 12 patients were treated by RAIB-TACE (RAIB-TACE group). In RAIB-TACE group, alternate infusion of cisplatin solution and sparse gelatin slurry (mixture of 80 mg of gelatin fragments and 20 mL of contrast medium) were repeated until arterial flow was ceased. In Lip-TACE group, lipiodol was used as drug carrier and dense gelatin slurry (mixture of 80 mg of gelatin fragments and 2 mL of contrast medium) as embolization material. Dynamic CT/MRI was obtained 1-3 months after TACE, and response of each nodule was evaluated basing on modified RECIST criteria.<i> Results.</i> In RAIB-TACE group, all 14 nodules (100&#x25;) were diagnosed as CR or PR. In Lip-TACE group, 18 of 29 (62.1&#x25;) were diagnosed as CR or PR. There was a statistically significant difference in objective response ratio between the groups (p=0.008, Fisher&#x2019;s test). Biloma (n=1) and benign stricture of the right hepatic duct (n=1) were seen in RAIB-TACE group. The biloma shrunk without treatment and the patient had no symptom, but the patient with biliary stricture repeated cholangitis and was treated by administration of antibiotics.<i> Conclusion.</i> The study results show that RAIB-TACE is more effective than lipiodol TACE/B-TACE for small hepatocellular carcinoma adjacent to GS. We speculate that one of the reasons to explain why Lip-TACE is inferior to RAIB-TACE is that viscous lipiodol or dense gelatin slurry could not flow into small tumor feeders effectively.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8350926/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:59:18.062Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:59:18.062Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552376ae9a4c4f652b3b41","title":"Trans-Cinnamaldehyde Inhibits IL-1β-Stimulated Inflammation in Chondrocytes by Suppressing NF-κB and p38-JNK Pathways and Exerts Chondrocyte Protective Effects in a Rat Model of Osteoarthritis","abstract":"<i>Objective</i>.

While studies have shown that mitophagy can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell damage, the role of Mdivi-1 and mitophagy remains unclear in acute lung injury (ALI) pathogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that Mdivi-1, which is widely used as an inhibitor of mitophagy, ameliorated acute lung injury assessed by HE staining, pulmonary microvascular permeability assay, measurement of wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio, and oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) analysis. Then, the mitophagy related proteins were evaluated by western blot. The results indicated that LPS-induced activation of mitophagy was inhibited by Mdivi-1 treatment. In addition, we found that Mdivi-1 protected A549 cells against LPS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. We also found that Mdivi-1 reduced pulmonary cell apoptosis in the LPS-challenged rats and protected pulmonary tissues from oxidative stress (represented by the content of superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde and lipid peroxides in lung). Moreover, Mdivi-1 treatment ameliorated LPS-induced lung inflammatory response and cells recruitment. These findings indicate that Mdivi-1 mitigates LPS-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in ALI, which may be associated with mitophagy inhibition.

To explore the changes in FSP27 expression and fat metabolism in adipose tissue and their relationship after bariatric surgery in rats.<i> Method</i>. Food intake, body weight, triglyceride content, fat distribution, and fat cell morphology were evaluated in rats grouped into control, sham, sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) groups. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to detect protein expression and real-time PCR was used to detect mRNA expression. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were used to assess the effects of different energy levels and nutrient factors on FSP27 in adipocytes.<i> Result</i>. Food intake, body weight, and triglyceride levels were reduced in RYGB and SG rats within 28 days after surgery, with a more pronounced effect in the RYGB group. Weight loss was mainly due to loss of fat mass rather than loss of lean mass, with the most pronounced decrease in trunk fat. FSP27 expression increased in lean rat adipocytes accompanied by increased lipid droplets (LDs). In SG and RYGB rats, the FSP27 protein concentration gradually increased in white adipose tissue (WAT) after operation. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), p-HSL/HSL, Adipose Triglyceride Lipase (ATGL), and Comparative Gene Identification-58 (CGI-58) gradually decreased in SG and RYGB rats, but they were always higher than in control and sham animals. FSP27 was also decreased in 3T3-L1 adipocytes of animals with a high-energy diet.<i> Conclusion</i>. FSP27 is associated with rat lipid metabolism and its expression varies with energy and nutrient supply.

Conventional suction-assisted cartilage shaver is effective; however, there are several risks and complications. Hence, we modified the conventional method to achieve better effectiveness and reduce complications. This paper aims to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and the complications arising from the modified suction-assisted cartilage shaver for AO. Thirty-nine patients (M/F=11/28, average age 26.3 years) received this surgical treatment for AO from 2013 to 2017 in the Department of Dermatology at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. A suction-assisted cartilage shaver was introduced for the ultimate removal of the subcutaneous tissue containing the apocrine glands. A 0.5 cm incision was made in the center of the identified elliptical surgical area at each axilla. After defatting, the incision was closed primarily. The defatting skin was anchored to the axillary fascia by using 4-0 sutures without drains. We then evaluated the clinical efficacy and complications. The mean duration of follow-up was 31.8 months (12&#x2013;68 months). Among patients receiving the modified cartilage shaving for AO, 92.3&#x25; achieved excellent-to-good results, 5.1&#x25; had acceptable results, and 2.6&#x25; had fair results. None of them experienced poor clinical efficacy. There was no skin necrosis, hematoma, nor wound infection after the surgery. There were no recurrences in all these patients 2 years after the surgery. This modified suction-assisted cartilage shaver for AO results in good efficacy, a low complication rate, and a low recurrence rate. The method is superior to the conventional one due to tissue glue-free procedure, greater comfort in postoperative care, minimal wounds, less hematoma, and less skin necrosis.

Subgroup analysis showed that telomere shortening was the most significant in Asian patients with CHD, in CHD patients with an average age &#x3c;65 years, and in men with CHD. The mechanism of shortening the telomere length leading to the occurrence and development of CHD is worthy of further study.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/5046867/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:59:53.254Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:59:53.254Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552399ae9a4c4f652b3b50","title":"Study on the Potential Biomarkers of Maternal Urine Metabolomics for Fetus with Congenital Heart Diseases Based on Modified Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer","abstract":"<i>Background.</i> There has been significant research on the genetic and environmental factors of congenital heart defects (CHDs), but few causes of teratogenicity, especially teratogenic mechanisms, can be clearly identified.

Pneumonia is a condition, where bacterial infections are implicated as the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in humans. The actual burden of HIV-infected patients with pneumonia is not well documented in Mekelle region of Ethiopia. This study estimated the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia in HIV patients, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogens implicated in pneumonia, and associated risk factors in Mekelle zone, Tigray, Northern Ethiopia, during August-December 2016.<i> Methods</i>. Sputum specimens were collected from 252 HIV seropositive individuals with suspected pneumonia. Data on sociodemographics and risk factors were also collected using a structured questionnaire. Blood, Chocolate, and Mac Conkey agar plates (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) were used to grow the isolates. The isolated colonies were identified based on Gram stain, colony morphology, pigmentation, hemolysis, and biochemical tests. The antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed using the modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method.

However, the mechanisms of intestinal dysfunction in LBW animals are still unclear. Milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), a protein-lipid complex surrounding the fat globules in milk, has many healthful benefits for animals. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore the effect of MFGM supplementation on intestinal injury and inflammation in LBW mouse pups while being challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). C57BL/6J LBW female neonatal mice were fed on breast milk and divided into four groups, including two normal diet groups (ND; CON group and LPS group) and the diet supplemented with two dosages of MFGM, namely, MFGM100 (ND plus MFGM at 100 mg/kg BW) and MFGM200 (ND plus MFGM at 200 mg/kg BW) from postnatal day (PND) 4 to PND 21. At PND21, pups from the LPS group, MFGM100 group, and MFGM200 group were injected intraperitoneally with LPS while the pups from the CON group were injected with equivalent volume of sterile saline. After 4 h of LPS administration, all pups were slaughtered and then the plasma, mid-ileum, and mid-colon tissue samples were collected. Our results showed that MFGM supplementation promoted the body weight from PND16 to PND21 and attenuated intestinal inflammation manifested by reduced histological damage, decreased secretion of TNF-<i>&#x3b1;</i>, IL-6, IFN-<i>&#x3b3;</i>, and IL-1<i>&#x3b2;</i>, and improved oxidative stress characterized by increased SOD activity and decreased secretion of MDA. Expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1), MUC1, and MUC2 was increased in MFGM presupplemented groups compared to the LPS-challenged mice with normal diet. Meanwhile, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and TLRs was decreased by MFGM presupplementation. Collectively, MFGM is a critical nutrient with an ability to improve the growth performance of LBW mouse pups, especially during the LPS challenge, by promoting the intestinal epithelial integrity and inhibiting inflammation through activating of TLR2 and TLR4 signals.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4876078/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T17:59:53.254Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T17:59:53.254Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5523aaae9a4c4f652b3b59","title":"Additive Value of Biomarkers and Echocardiography to Stratify the Risk of Death in Heart Failure Patients with Reduced Ejection Fraction","abstract":"<i>Background</i>.

In 2016, the Kenyan Ministry of Health (MOH) released guidelines that recommend preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for persons with substantial ongoing HIV risk, including those in HIV serodiscordant partnerships.

We estimated the incremental annual costs of providing PrEP to HIV uninfected partners as a time-limited &#x201c;bridge&#x201d; until the infected partner is virally suppressed on ART within HIV serodiscordant couples as part of routine clinic care in Thika, Kenya. Costs were collected from the Partners Demonstration Project, a prospective evaluation of integrated delivery of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) to high-risk HIV serodiscordant couples. We conducted time and motion studies to distinguish between activities related to research, routine clinical care, and PrEP delivery. Costs (2015 US dollars) were collected from the MOH perspective and divided into staff, transportation, equipment, supplies, buildings and overhead, and start-up.<i> Results</i>. PrEP related activities conducted during the screening, enrollment, and follow-up visits took an average of 13 minutes, 51 minutes, and 12 minutes, respectively. Assuming a staff structure of 3 counselors, 1 nurse, and 2 clinicians, we estimate that 3,178 couples can be screened, 1,444 couples offered PrEP and ART, and 6,138 couples followed up annually in an average HIV care clinic. Using costs incurred by the MOH for personnel, drug, and laboratory tests, we estimate that the incremental cost of offering PrEP to HIV uninfected partners within existing ART programs is &#x24;86.79 per couple per year. Personnel and PrEP medication made up the largest portion of the costs. We estimate that the total cost to Ministry of Health of delivering integrated PrEP and ART program in public health facilities is &#x24;250.19 per HIV serodiscordant couple per year.<i> Conclusions</i>. Time-limited provision of PrEP to the HIV uninfected partner within HIV serodiscordant couples can be an affordable delivery model implemented in HIV care programs in Kenya and similar settings. These costs can be used for budgetary planning and cost effectiveness analyses.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/art/2019/4170615/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:00:34.129Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:00:34.129Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5523c2ae9a4c4f652b3b65","title":"Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease: Screening for Magnesium Deficiency","abstract":"Magnesium is an essential mineral naturally present in the human body, where it acts as cofactor in several enzymatic reactions.

Second, DEGs were separately analyzed by Gene Ontology enrichment and pathways analyses. Third, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to further investigate the interactions of DEGs. A total of 123 DEGs were identified between sexes, including 8 upregulated and 115 downregulated genes. In the PPI network, ten key genes were identified, including IL1<i>&#x3b1;</i>, IL1<i>&#x3b2;</i>, IL6, IL8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL20, CCL4, ICAM1, and PTGS2. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in biological processes of immune response and apoptotic process, also in pathways of TNF and NOD-like receptor signaling. In conclusion, the above ten genes may have a protective effect on IS females through their direct or indirect involvement in biological processes of immune response and apoptotic process, as well as in TNF and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways.

Highly abundant proteins, particularly human serum albumin (HSA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), typically interfere with investigation of proteins with lower abundance. A relatively simple preparation method based on high temperature can precipitate thermolabile proteins, providing a strategic window to access the thermostable plasma subproteome. This study aimed to optimize thermal treatment as a reliable prefractionation method and to compare it with two commercial kits, including HSA and IgG immunodepletion (IMDP) and combinatorial peptide ligand libraries (CPLL), using untreated plasma as a control condition. By varying the temperature and the incubation period, the optimal condition was found as treatment at 95&#xb0;C for 20 min, which maintained about 1&#x25; recovery yield of soluble proteins. Consistency and reproducibility of thermal treatment-derived plasma subproteome were checked by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The coefficient of variation regarding protein spot numbers was less than 10&#x25; among three independent specimens. Highly abundant protein depletion of the thermal treatment was evaluated by immunoblotting against HSA and IgG as compared to the untreated plasma, IMDP, and CPLL. Multidimensional comparison based on 489 unique peptides derived from the label-free quantitative mass spectrometry revealed that the thermal treatment, IMDP, and CPLL provided distinct sets of plasma subproteome compared to untreated plasma, and these appeared to be complementary to each other. Comparing the characteristics of the three procedures suggested that thermal treatment was more cost-effective and less time-consuming than IMDP and CPLL. This study proposes the use of thermal treatment as a reliable and cost-effective method for plasma prefractionation which provides benefits to large-scale proteomic projects and biomarker studies.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8646039/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:00:48.397Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:00:48.397Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5523d0ae9a4c4f652b3b6d","title":"The Laminin-α1 Chain-Derived Peptide, AG73, Binds to Syndecans on MDA-231 Breast Cancer Cells and Alters Filopodium Formation","abstract":"Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer affecting women in the United States, second only to skin cancers.

We performed adhesion assays using MCF10A, T47D, SUM1315, and MDA-231 breast cell lines and found that AG73 binds to syndecans (Sdcs) 1, 2, and 4. This interaction was inhibited when we silenced Sdcs 1 and/or 4 in MDA-231 cells, indicating the importance of these receptors in this relationship. Through actin staining, we found that silencing of Sdc 1, 2, and 4 expression in MDA-231 cells exhibits a decrease in the length and number of filopodia bound to AG73. Expression of mouse Sdcs 1, 2, and 4 in MDA-231 cells provides rescue in filopodia, and overexpression of Sdcs 1 and 2 leads to increased filopodium length and number. Our findings demonstrate an intrinsic interaction between AG73 in the tumor environment and the Sdcs on breast cancer cells in supporting tumor cell adhesion and invasion through filopodia, an important step in cancer metastasis.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/acp/2019/9192516/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:00:48.397Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:00:48.397Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5523d0ae9a4c4f652b3b6e","title":"Fourier-Based Footfall Placement Variability in Parkinson’s Disease","abstract":"The current investigation examined whether Parkinson’s patients (PD) have greater Fourier-based footfall placement gait with the greatest mobility dysfunction variability (FPV) than the age and gender matched control group and that variability would be the greatest in the PD participants with the greatest mobility dysfunction indexed Hoehn/Yahr scale. 35 persons undergoing PD and 30 age-matched controls participated in this investigation.

Data were analysed using descriptive and binary logistic regression analyses at 5&#x25; confidence interval.<i> Results</i>. The descriptive findings indicated a vast variation between antenatal care attendance and skilled birth attendance. Skilled birth attendance was consistently low across almost all sociodemographic characteristics as compared to antenatal care attendance. The binary logistic regression analysis however indicated higher inclination toward skilled birth attendance among women who had at least four antenatal care visits [OR=5.87, CI=4.86-7.08].

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and malignant type of primary brain tumors in adults. The valuable prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for GBM remain to be elucidated. The association of adipokines with cancer has been well documented. The C1q/TNF-related protein 1 (CTRP1), a novel adipokine, belongs to the CTRP family.<i> Methods</i>. In the present study, the expression and potential roles of CTRP1 in GBM were explored based on in silico evaluation, including GEPIA, the Pathology Atlas of the Human Protein Atlas, cBioPortal, TIMER, and SurvExpress. The CCK8, transwell, and wound healing assays were used to detect cell proliferation and migration.<i> Results</i>. It was found that mRNA expression levels of<i> CTRP1</i> were significantly upregulated in GBM tissues compared with those in nontumor tissues according to the analysis on public dataset and immunohistochemical results of GBM tissues (<i>P</i>&#x3c;0.05). CTRP1 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and cell membrane of GBM cells. The genetic alterations of CTRP1 occurred at a low rate in GBM (2 of 591 sequenced cases/patients, 0.33&#x25;). The mRNA expression levels of<i> CTRP1</i> were positively associated with the tumor-infiltrating macrophages and CCL2 in GBM (<i>P</i>&#x3c;0.05, respectively). The higher mRNA expression levels of<i> CTRP1</i> were significantly correlated with higher risk and shorter overall survival time in GBM (<i>P</i>&#x3c;0.05). CTRP1 knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration in human GBM cells, suggesting the inhibition of CTRP1 on human GMB progression. Moreover, CTRP1 knockdown inhibited CCL2 expression, and CCL2 overexpression reversed the inhibition of cell proliferation and migration induced by CTRP1 knockdown, suggesting that CTRP1 promoted tumor progression by regulating CCL2 expression.<i> Conclusions</i>. These findings suggest that CTRP1 potentially indicates poor prognosis in GBM and promotes the progression of human GBM.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/2582416/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:00:48.397Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:00:48.397Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5523d0ae9a4c4f652b3b72","title":"Antithrombotic Dilemmas after Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Watchman Device Placement","abstract":"Antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has dramatically shifted from warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, to the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban.

Therefore, identifying the master regulators underlying ATC progression is desperately needed. In our present study, three datasets including GSE33630, GSE29265, and GSE65144 were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus with a total of 32 ATC samples and 78 normal thyroid tissues. A total of 1804 consistently changed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from three datasets. KEGG pathways enrichment suggested that upregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in ECM-receptor interaction, cell cycle, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, focal adhesion, and p53 signaling pathway. Furthermore, key gene modules in PPI network were identified by Cytoscape plugin MCODE and they were mainly associated with DNA replication, cell cycle process, collagen fibril organization, and regulation of leukocyte migration. Additionally, TOP2A, CDK1, CCNB1, VEGFA, BIRC5, MAPK1, CCNA2, MAD2L1, CDC20, and BUB1 were identified as hub genes of the PPI network. Interestingly, module analysis showed that 8 out of 10 hub genes participated in Module 1 network and more than 70&#x25; genes of Module 2 consisted of collagen family members. Notably, transcription factors (TFs) regulatory network analysis indicated that E2F7, FOXM1, and NFYB were master regulators of Module 1, while CREB3L1 was the master regulator of Module 2. Experimental validation showed that CREB3L1, E2F7, and FOXM1 were significantly upregulated in ATC tissue and cell line when compared with normal thyroid group. In conclusion, the TFs regulatory network provided a more detail molecular mechanism underlying ATC occurrence and progression. TFs including E2F7, FOXM1, CREB3L1, and NFYB were likely to be master regulators of ATC progression, suggesting their potential role as molecular therapeutic targets in ATC treatment.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9734576/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:05.718Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:05.718Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5523e1ae9a4c4f652b3b77","title":"Patients Selection for Immunotherapy in Solid Tumors: Overcome the Naïve Vision of a Single Biomarker","abstract":"Immunotherapy, and in particular immune-checkpoints blockade therapy (ICB), represents a new pillar in cancer therapy.

This study aimed to characterize the psychomotor effects of nicotine administration and then investigate the consequences of two types of repeated social defeat stress (episodic and continuous) on nicotine-induced psychomotor effects in mice. Adult male Swiss mice were treated for 13 days with daily injections of nicotine (0.1, 0.4, or 1.0&#x2009;mg/kg, s.c.) and received saline and nicotine challenges (0, 0.1 and 0.4&#x2009;mg/kg) after a withdrawal period. Dose-dependent effects were observed in locomotor response to nicotine, with trends for locomotor stimulation after intermittent (but not acute) administration of 0.1&#x2009;mg/kg. Higher nicotine doses caused acute locomotor suppression (0.4 and 1.0&#x2009;mg/kg) and tolerance after intermittent administration (0.4&#x2009;mg/kg dose). In separate cohorts, experimental mice were daily defeated by aggressive mice, using the resident-intruder model, for 10 days. After brief confrontations, intruders returned to their home cage (episodic stress) or were continuously exposed to the aggressive resident for 24&#x2009;h (continuous stress), until the following defeat. After the 10-day stress protocol, mice received saline and nicotine challenges (0 and 0.1&#x2009;mg/kg, s.c.) in locomotor tests. Mice were also tested for methamphetamine-induced locomotor response (1.0&#x2009;mg/kg, i.p.). Both defeat protocols induced short-term locomotor suppression (24h after stress), which was further suppressed by nicotine only in mice exposed to continuous defeat stress. Ten days after stress, locomotor behavior was no longer suppressed in defeated mice of either stress protocol. Mice exposed to continuous defeat stress showed a reduced stimulant response to methamphetamine, 12 days after termination of stress. Our findings indicate that exposure to continuous defeat stress facilitates nicotine-induced locomotor suppression shortly after stress and reduces methamphetamine-induced stimulation in the long term.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/5404251/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:05.719Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:05.719Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5523e1ae9a4c4f652b3b7b","title":"Adherence to Antiplatelet Therapy after Coronary Intervention among Patients with Myocardial Infarction Attending Vietnam National Heart Institute","abstract":"Adherence to antiplatelet therapy is critical to successful treatment of cardiovascular conditions. However, little has been known about this issue in the context of constrained resources such as in Vietnam. The objective of this study was to examine the adherence to antiplatelet therapy among patients receiving acute myocardial infarction interventions and its associated factors. In a cross-sectional survey design, 175 adult patients revisiting Vietnam National Heart Institute diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction were approached for data collection from October 2014 to June 2015. Adherence to antiplatelet therapy was assessed by asking patients whether they took taking antiplatelet regularly as per medication (do not miss any dose at the specified time) for any type of antiplatelet (aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine...) during the last month before the participants came back to take re-examinations. The results indicated that the adherence to antiplatelet therapy among patients was quite high at 1 month; it begins to decline by 6 months, 12 months, and more than 12 months (less than 1 month was 90.29&#x25;; from 1 to 6 months 88.0&#x25;, from 6 to 12 months 75.43&#x25;, and after 12 months only 46.29&#x25; of patients).

Total RNA was extracted, and quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA were performed to investigate the expressions of miRNAs and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), respectively. We found that plasma levels of miR-22-5p and miR-150-3p were significantly higher during the early stage of AMI and their expression levels peaked earlier than cTnI. Conversely, circulating miR-132-5p was sustained at a low level during the early phase of AMI. All three circulating miRNAs were correlated with plasma cTnI levels. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis suggested that each single miRNA had considerable diagnostic efficacy for AMI. Moreover, combining the three miRNAs improved their diagnostic efficacy. Furthermore, neither heparin nor medications for coronary heart disease (CHD) affected plasma levels of miR-22-5p and miR-132-5p, but circulating miR-150-3p was downregulated by medications for CHD. We concluded that plasma miR-22-5p, miR-132-5p, and miR-150-3p may serve as candidate diagnostic biomarkers for early diagnosis of AMI.

Optimal use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is crucial to improve the treatment outcome in heart failure patients. However, little is known about the optimal use of ACEIs among heart failure patients in our setting. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the utilization and optimal dosing of ACEIs and associated factors in heart failure patients.<i> Method</i>. A cross-sectional study was conducted on randomly selected patients with heart failure between February 2016 and June 2016 at ambulatory care clinic of Jimma University Medical Center, Ethiopia. Data were collected through patient interview and review of medical records. Binary logistic regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with utilization and optimal dosing of ACEIs.<i> Results</i>. A total of 308 patients were included in the final analysis of this study. The mean (&#xb1;standard deviation) age of the patients was 52.3 &#xb1;15.5 years.

The inhibition ratio of IFN-<i>&#x3b1;</i> (6000&#x2009;IU) was -29.5&#x25;, while that for IFN-<i>&#x3b1;</i> (6000&#x2009;IU) + SFI (0.5&#x2009;g/L) was 17.0&#x25;, which was significantly higher than that for the IFN-<i>&#x3b1;</i> group (P &#x3c; 0.01). The VEGF gene was silenced successfully in MHCC97-L cells. After interference of VEGF, the inhibition by SFI and IFN-<i>&#x3b1;</i> in MHCC97L-mir200 did not differ from that in MHCC97-L cells (P &#x3e; 0.05). SFI can reduce the expression of VEGF in HCC, which can increase the efficacy of IFN-<i>&#x3b1;</i>, providing a theoretical basis for clinical application.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8084109/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:21.434Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:21.434Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5523f1ae9a4c4f652b3b85","title":"Novel Hybrid Gels Made of High and Low Molecular Weight Hyaluronic Acid Induce Proliferation and Reduce Inflammation in an Osteoarthritis In Vitro Model Based on Human Synoviocytes and Chondrocytes","abstract":"High molecular weight hyaluronan (H-HA) has a pivotal role in the maintenance of normal functions of synovial fluid and structure of the articular joint, but it has been shown that its concentration is reduced in patients affected by degenerative cartilage diseases, such as osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and properties of hybrid cooperative complexes based on high and low molecular weight hyaluronan (HCC) compared to H-HA on human primary cells derived by pathological joints. In addition, the rheological behavior of HCC was evaluated in order to define their potential as viscosupplement gel in degenerated joints. The experiments were performed using an<i> in vitro</i> model of OA based on human chondrocytes and synoviocytes isolated from degenerated joints of patients hospitalized for surgical replacement. In order to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of HCC, we evaluated NF-kB, COMP-2, IL-6, and IL-8 as specific markers at the transcriptional and/or protein level. Moreover, the proliferative properties of HCC were assessed using time lapse video microscopy. We showed that chondrocytes and synoviocytes clearly presented an altered cytokine profile compatible with a severe ongoing inflammation status. H-HA and, above all, HCC significantly reduced levels of the specific biomarkers evaluated and improved cartilage healing. The rheological profile indicated HCC suitability for intra-articular injection in joint diseases. HCC viscoelastic properties and the protective/anti-inflammatory effect on human chondrocytes and synoviocytes suggest the novel HCC-based gels as a valid support for OA management.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4328219/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:21.434Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:21.434Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5523f1ae9a4c4f652b3b87","title":"Cigarette Smoke Extract Exposure: Effects on the Interactions between Titanium Surface and Osteoblasts","abstract":"The aim of this study was to explore the changes in the characteristics of titanium surface and the osteoblast-titanium interactions under cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure. In this study, CSE was used to simulate the oral liquid environment around the implant under cigarette smoke exposure. Titanium samples were immersed in CSE to explore the changes in the characteristics of titanium surface. The physical properties of titanium surface were measured, including surface micromorphology, surface elemental composition, roughness, and surface hydrophilicity. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured on the titanium surface<i> in vitro</i> under different concentrations of CSE exposure, and cell adhesion, cell proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation were observed. The surface micromorphology and elemental composition of titanium surface changed under CSE exposure. No obvious changes were found in the surface roughness and the hydrophilicity of titanium samples. Moreover, the results of<i> in vitro</i> study showed that CSE exposure downregulated the cell spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells on the titanium surface. It could be speculated that some carbon-containing compounds from CSE adsorbed on the titanium surface and the osteoblast-titanium interactions were influenced under CSE exposure. It is hoped that these results could provide valuable information for further studies on smoking-mediated inhibition of implants osseointegration.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8759568/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:21.434Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:21.434Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5523f1ae9a4c4f652b3b88","title":"Donor and Recipient Outcomes following Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Living Donor Nephrectomy: A Systematic Review","abstract":"<i>Aims</i>.

Primary human LECs were separated and cultured. Microarray analysis showed that a total of 568 lncRNAs are differentially expressed in primary HLECs in the presence of TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i>2 and MALAT1 is mostly significantly dysregulated lncRNAs, which is increased by nearly 17-fold. In addition, upregulation of MALAT1 and downregulation of miR-26a were detected in human posterior capsule opacification (PCO) attached LECs and the LECs obtained from patients with anterior polar cataracts by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Next, our results showed that TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i>2 induces overexpression of EMT markers in primary HLECs via a MALAT1-dependent mechanism. The mechanism is that MALAT1 negatively regulates miR-26a and miR-26a directly targets Smad4 by luciferase reporter assays and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assay. In summary, TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i>2 induces MALAT1 overexpression, which in turn MALAT1 acts as a ceRNA targeting Smad4 by binding miR-26a and promotes the progression of EMT of LECs.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/1569638/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:36.723Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:36.723Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552400ae9a4c4f652b3b8c","title":"The Efficacy and Safety of Transcatheter Arterial Embolization to Treat Renal Hemorrhage after Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy","abstract":"<i>Purpose</i>.

However, previous evidence has suggested that there is no clear relationship between serum leptin concentrations and lung cancer progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the most abundant component of the tumor microenvironment in a variety of solid tumors, were recently reported to produce leptin. Therefore, it was inferred that leptin is most likely to affect non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through an autocrine and paracrine mechanism. In the current study, we investigated the paracrine effect and mechanism of leptin produced by CAFs on NSCLC by establishing a novel in vitro cell coculture system.<i> Methods.</i> A noncontact coculture device was designed and made by 3D printing. CAFs and paired normal lung fibroblasts (NLFs) from 5 patients were successfully isolated and cocultured with two NSCLC cell lines in a coculture system. The background expression of leptin was detected by western blot. The in situ expression of leptin and its receptor (Ob-R) in NSCLC tissues and paired normal lung tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we downregulated the expression of leptin in CAFs and assessed changes in its promotion on NSCLC cells in the coculture system. Finally, changes in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT were examined to investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the paracrine promotion of NSCLC cells by leptin.<i> Results.</i> Leptin was overexpressed in nearly all five primary CAF lines compared with its expression in paired NLFs. IHC staining showed that the expression of leptin was high in NSCLC cells, slightly lower in CAF, and negative in normal lung tissue. Ob-R was strongly expressed in NSCLC cells. The ability of A549 and H1299 cells to proliferate and migrate was enhanced by high leptin levels in both the cocultured fibroblasts and the culture medium. Furthermore, western blot assays suggested that the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways were activated by leptin produced by CAFs, which demonstrated that the functions of paracrine leptin in NSCLC are as those of the serum leptin to other cancers.<i> Conclusion.</i> Leptin produced by CAF promotes proliferation and migration of NSCLC cells probably via PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways in a paracrine manner.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/2585743/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:50.817Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:01:50.817Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55240eae9a4c4f652b3b95","title":"FBW7 Regulates the Autophagy Signal in Mesangial Cells Induced by High Glucose","abstract":"<i>Aims</i>.

High glucose can downregulate the expression of FBW7 and activate mTOR signal, which leads to diminished autophagy in renal mesangial cells, as well as renal inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic factors. RAPA, as a specifically inhibitor of mTOR, can decrease inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic factors by inhibiting mTOR.

Reduced baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) has been reported in patients with acute cardiovascular events. We tested the hypothesis that BRS varies in different subtypes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and that BRS is a predictor of clinical outcomes.<i> Methods</i>. We examined autonomic parameters in 34 patients with AIS, including the small deep hemisphere infarction, the large hemisphere infarction, and the brainstem infarction groups on Day 1, Day 7, and Day 30 after AIS. Autonomic parameters were also evaluated in 18 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers as a control group. The clinical outcomes were analyzed using the modified Rankin scale at 30 days after stroke.<i> Results</i>. The BRS, Valsalva ratio, and heart rate response to deep breathing (HR-DB) were significantly lower in patients after AIS on admission than in controls (<i>p</i>&#x3c;0.01). The frequency domain of HRV (LF/HF ratio) was significantly increased in patients after AIS compared to controls (<i>p</i>&#x3c;0.05). BRS was significantly reduced in patients with large hemisphere infarction or brainstem infarction compared to patients with small deep hemisphere infarction on Day 1 after AIS (<i>p</i>&#x3c;0.01).

In an in vitro study, primary cardiomyocytes were treated with Hypoxia/Reoxygenation (H/R) to simulate the I/R. DHM reduced the infarct area and improved cardiac function. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction was alleviated after DHM treatment. Moreover, DHM alleviated oxidative stress indicated by decreased ROS and MnSOD. However, the beneficial function of DHM was abolished after removing the Sirt3. On the other hand, the mitochondrial function was improved after DHM intervention in vitro study. Interestingly, Sirt3 downregulation inhibited the beneficial function of DHM. Therefore, the advantages of DHM are involved in the improvement of mitochondrial function and decreased oxidative stress through the upregulation of Sirt3. DHM offers a promising therapeutic avenue for better outcome in the patients with cardiac I/R injury.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/6803943/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:02:24.731Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:02:24.731Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552430ae9a4c4f652b3bab","title":"Case Definitions of Clinical Malaria in Children from Three Health Districts in the North Region of Cameroon","abstract":"Malaria endemicity in Cameroon greatly varies according to ecological environment. In such conditions, parasitaemia, which is associated with fever, may not always suffice to define an episode of clinical malaria. The evaluation of malaria control intervention strategies mostly consists of identifying cases of clinical malaria and is crucial to promote better diagnosis for accurate measurement of the impact of the intervention. We sought out to define and quantify clinical malaria cases in children from three health districts in the Northern region of Cameroon. A cohort study of 6,195 children aged between 6 and 120 months was carried out during the raining season (July to October) between 2013 and 2014. Differential diagnosis of clinical malaria was performed using the parasite density and axillary temperature. At recruitment, patients with malaria-related symptoms (fever [axillary temperature &#x2265; 37.5&#xb0;C], chills, severe malaise, headache, or vomiting) and a malaria positive blood smear were classified under clinical malaria group. The malaria attributable fraction was calculated using logistic regression models.<i> Plasmodium falciparum</i> was responsible for over 91&#x25; of infections. Children from Pitoa health district had the highest number of asymptomatic infections (45.60&#x25;) compared to those from Garoua and Mayo Oulo. The most suitable cut-off for the association between parasite densities and fever was found among children less than 24 months. Overall, parasite densities that ranged above 3,200 parasites per <i>&#x3bc;</i>l of blood could be used to define the malaria attributable fever cases. In groups of children aged between 24 and 59 months and 60 and 94 months, the optimum cut-off parasite density was 6,400 parasites per <i>&#x3bc;</i>l of blood, while children aged between 95 and 120 months had a cut-off of 800 parasites per <i>&#x3bc;</i>l of blood. In the same ecoepidemiological zone, clinical malaria case definitions are influenced by age and location (health district) and this could be considered when evaluating malaria intervention strategies in endemic areas.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9709013/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:02:24.731Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:02:24.731Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552430ae9a4c4f652b3baa","title":"LncRNA-MIAT Increased in Patients with Coronary Atherosclerotic Heart Disease","abstract":"<i>Background</i>.

A great amount of bone metabolic turnover markers have been tested, but none of them seems to be relevant in case of prevention or diagnosis of HO. The most effective prophylactic treatment is radiotherapy or administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Over the years a lot of different RT protocols have been tested. Nowadays the most often used regimen is 7 Gy given postoperatively in a single dose. The most commonly prescribed drug in prophylaxis of HO is indomethacin.

The rate of contamination of eye drops in the study setup was found to be 51/70 (72.8%). Frequency of contamination of eye drops found was to be statistically associated with the duration of use of eye drops. Contaminations of eye drops were high among patients who self-administer the medications and those individuals who apply the medication less frequently. Tips of the bottles were more often contaminated than the content of the eye drop. Majority of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms were sensitive for most of the broad-spectrum antibiotics; however, there were a significant number of Gram-negative organisms resistant to almost all antibiotics used. <i>Conclusion</i>. There is high rate of contamination of eye drops in the setup (72.8%). Duration of use of eye drops is a significant factor associated with contamination. Knowing duration time of each container and patient education on eye drop administration technique are mandatory.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cjidmm/2019/5372530/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:02:24.731Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:02:24.731Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552442ae9a4c4f652b3bb3","title":"Body Mass Index and Primary Headache: A Hospital-Based Study in China","abstract":"<i>Objective</i>. Primary headache and obesity are highly prevalent disorders in the general population. Although many studies have reported an association between the two, there is still no overall comprehension about this relationship. To gain a more accurate understanding in this regard, we analyzed data from a 2011 cross-sectional study in Chongqing, China.<i> Methods</i>. Patients with a chief complaint of headache were administered a headache questionnaire and diagnosed by neurology doctors in accordance with the International Classification of Headache Disorders 2nd Edition (ICHD-II) criteria. Patients aged &#x3c; 18 years or diagnosed with secondary headache were excluded.<i> Results</i>. Of 1327 patients who cited headache as the chief complaint, 16 were excluded for missing data, while 396 were diagnosed with chronic headache (177 chronic migraine [CM], 186 chronic tension-type headache [CTTH], and 33 other chronic headache) and 915 with episodic headache (369 episodic migraine [EM], 319 episodic tension-type headache [ETTH], and 227 other episodic headache). Chronic headache patients had a higher number of headache days per month, longer duration of headache history, and greater tendency to overuse analgesics than episodic headache patients. The CM and ETTH patients were more apt to be overweight and had a significantly greater body mass index (BMI; p &#x3c; 0.05) than the EM and CTTH patients. Overweight (odds ratio [OR] = 3.64; 95&#x25; confidence interval (CI), 1.19&#x2013;8.81) and obesity (OR = 28.63; 95&#x25; CI, 2.96&#x2013;276.6) were independently associated with CM but not with other headaches, and this association was not influenced by other factors such as medication overuse.<i> Conclusions</i>. The relationship between headache and overweight/obesity varies depending on the type of primary headache. CM patients are more likely to have a higher body mass index than EM patients, while ETTH patients are more likely to be overweight/obese than CTTH patients.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4630490/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:02:42.116Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:02:42.116Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552442ae9a4c4f652b3bb2","title":"Amides Derived from Vanillic Acid: Coupling Reactions, Antimicrobial Evaluation, and Molecular Docking","abstract":"A series of amides derived from vanillic acid were obtained by coupling reactions using PyBOP ((Benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate) and DCC (Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) coupling reagents.

Subjects were examined twice: 1 week before training and a week immediately after intervention. Gait was evaluated by the Vicon 250: a computerized system of three-dimensional analysis of motion, connected to 5 infrared video cameras. We conducted mixed-design ANOVA model to assess the effects of time and type of training on spatiotemporal parameters. We found significant favorable time by group interaction in the following parameters: step length in right leg: F(1,15) =14,47, p=0.002; left leg accordingly F(1,15) =5,15, p=0.038, cycle length in right leg: F(1,15) =14,48, p=0.002; left leg accordingly F(1,15) =15,09, p=0.001; and gait standardised speed F(1,15) =5,35, p=0.035.

The hyaluronic acid coated on the surface of mesoporous hollow alumina nanoparticles (MHA) regulated the drug release rate and the loaded samples obtained a sustained drug release. In vitro experiments demonstrated that paclitaxel-hyaluronic acid functionalized mesoporous hollow alumina nanoparticles (PAC-HMHA) had a high cellular uptake, which increased the drug level in tumor tissues and was beneficial to promote apoptosis.

Gene Oncology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were carried out to gain insight into the actions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). As a result, 20 genes (CALB1, CDC20, CDCA8, CDK1, CEP55, DLGAP5, KIF20A, KIF4A, NDC80, PBK, RRM2, SYN1, SYP, SYT1, TPX2, TTK, VEGFA, BDNF, GNG3, and TOP2A) were found as hub genes via CytoHubba in Cytoscape and functioned mainly by participating in cell cycle and p53 signaling pathway; among them, RRM2 and CEP55 were considered to have relationship with the prognosis of glioblastoma, especially RRM2. High expression of RRM2 was consistent with shorter overall survival time. In conclusion, our study displayed the bioinformatic analysis methods in screening potential oncogenes in glioblastoma and underlying mechanisms.

This article reports a C-terminal region consisting of peptides 39255 and 39256 (<sup>81</sup>Thr-Arg<sup>114</sup>) having high specific binding regarding two infection-related cell lines (A549 and U937); they inhibited mycobacterial entry to U937 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.

Hydrotalcite plays an important role in the therapy of gastric ulcer induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but little is known about the mechanism. We designed two experiments to study the preventive and curative effects of hydrotalcite on NSAIDs-related gastric injury in rats and to investigate the relationship between the protective and curative mechanism of hydrotalcite and the secretion of epidermal growth factor (EGF)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).<i> Methods</i>. Two experiments were separately designed to evaluate the preventive and curative effects of hydrotalcite. A total of 25 male rats and 25 female rats were randomly divided into five groups (vehicle group, model group, omeprazole group, hydrotalcite group, and ranitidine group) in each experiment.

One hundred fifty-five hospital workers were studied within the framework of a cross-sectional study. We collected physiological, pathological, and occupational history including pack-years, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and night shifts, together with blood and urine samples. Relationships were appraised by univariate and multivariate ordered-logistic regression models. We found that workers with good and excellent WAI present higher FEV1 (p&#x3c; 0.01) and number of night-work shifts (p&#x3c;0.05), but they reveal higher urinary levels of 8-oxoGua (p&#x3c;0.01) and shorter LTL (p&#x3c;0.05).

This rate of survival can be improved by earlier nodule detection. Accordingly, the accurate recognition of the nodule is of the utmost importance in providing powerful results in building the survival rate. The reduction in the accuracy of manual or semiautomatic segmentation methods for thyroid nodule detection is due to many factors, basically, the lack of experience of the sonographer and latency of operation. Most lesion regions in ultrasound images are homogeneous. Therefore, the value of entropy in these regions is high compared to its neighbours. Based on this criterion, a novel procedure for automatically selecting the seed point in thyroid nodule images is proposed. The proposed system consists of three components: neutrosophic image enhancement and speckle reduction to reduce speckle noise and automatic seed selection algorithm extracted from the centre of candidate block in ultrasound thyroid images based on the principle that most of its Higher Order Spectra Entropies (HOSE) from Radon Transform (RT) at different angles are within the range between average and maximum entropies, and the region growing image segmentation is applied with the constant threshold.

It is often associated with abnormalities of the ventricular repolarization phase; the dispersion of ventricular repolarization is the basis for ventricular arrhythmias (torsion de point, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation).<i> Objectives</i>. Analysis of abnormal ventricular repolarization focused on the presence and amount of U wave in patients affected by pheochromocytoma and its modification after surgery.<i> Materials and Methods</i>. We reviewed pathology records of 722 patients admitted for adrenal nodule or suspected chromaffin-cell tumor and identified 39 patients affected by pheochromocytoma. Metanephrine, normetanephrine, and 3-methoxytyramine have been assessed by determining concentrations in 24-hour urine collection. Standard 12-lead electrocardiogram records have been reviewed with analysis of heart rate, P wave, PR interval, QRS duration, QTc, and U wave. Then we selected and compared 22 patients of 39 affected by pheochromocytoma, with both clinical and electrocardiographic data before and after surgery.<i> Results</i>. In our cohort of 39 patients affected by pheochromocytoma, we found U wave in ECG, before treatment, in 82.8 percent of patients, while only 37.0 percent after treatment (p&#x3c;0.001) and we observed a statistically significant correlation between this wave and the urinary metanephrine. After surgery, in the selected 22 patients, we observed a clear significant reduction in systemic blood pressure, fasting glucose, metanephrine, normetanephrine, and 3-methoxytyramine. We found a significant reduction of U wave presence and leads involved in these patients after surgery (90.9&#x25; versus 9&#x25;). We observed a linear correlation between the amount of U waves in 12-lead electrocardiogram and metanephrine (r<sup>2</sup>=0.333, p=0.015), 3-methoxytyramine levels (r<sup>2</sup>=0.458, p=0.006), and tumor size (r<sup>2</sup>=0.429, p=0.003).<i> Conclusions</i>. In our retrospective analysis, patients affected by pheochromocytoma presented U wave in electrocardiogram. The presence and amount of U wave were associated with the metanephrine levels and the tumor size with significant reduction after surgical removal.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/2605323/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:03:14.437Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:03:14.437Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552462ae9a4c4f652b3bcf","title":"Arsenic Trioxide Suppresses Tumor Growth through Antiangiogenesis via Notch Signaling Blockade in Small-Cell Lung Cancer","abstract":"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly malignant type of lung cancer with no effective second-line chemotherapy drugs.

We suggest, however, perseverating in this update as the optimal DAA regimen may not be proposed yet, because of the expected arrival of newer DAAs and of the lack of data from large multicenter randomized controlled trials.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4674560/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:03:45.087Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:03:45.087Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552481ae9a4c4f652b3be0","title":"The Effects of Oral Isotretinoin in Women with Acne and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome","abstract":"<i>Introduction</i>. Many patients who were diagnosed as polycystic ovary syndrome- (PCOS-) related acne were not capable of sustaining or beginning oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) due to pill scaring, contraindications of OCP use, migraine, or smoking. In this situation, oral isotretinoin treatment may become an important option for PCOS-related acne. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of isotretinoin treatment on PCOS patients who were complicated with severe cystic acne.<i> Materials and Methods</i>. This study consisted of 40 female patients diagnosed as PCOS complicated with severe cystic acne. These patients were not eligible candidates for OCP use due to migraine, thrombophilia, heavy smoking, or pill scare. To establish baseline values of hormone levels, on days 2&#x2013;5 of the menstrual cycle, venous blood samples were obtained. Moreover Modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) score, acne score (AS), follicle count, and bilateral ovarian volumes were evaluated both before and after isotretinoin treatment.<i> Results</i>. Isotretinoin treatment significantly decreased Ferriman-Gallwey score, free testosterone, insulin level, hemoglobin level, acne score, and ovarian volume.

Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) involves immune response, regulation of oxidative stress, and maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential as well as energy production. However, whether and how UCP2 plays roles in the development of septic cardiac dysfunction are largely unknown. Here, intraperitoneal injection of LPS significantly activated UCP2 expression accompanied by a significant decrease of cardiac function and caused a significantly lower survival rate in mice. Of note, knockdown of UCP2 through a cardiotropic adenoassociated viral vector carrying a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specifically targeting the UCP2 evoked resistance to LPS-triggered septic cardiac dysfunction and lethality<i> in vivo</i>. Moreover, UCP2 deficiency ameliorated the reduced levels of intracellular ATP in the LPS-challenged heart tissues and preserved mitochondrial membrane potential loss in primary adult mouse cardiomyocytes in LPS-challenged animals. Mechanistically, we confirmed that the inhibition of UCP2 promoted autophagy in response to LPS, as shown by an increase in LC3II and a decrease in p62. At last, the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA abolished UCP2 knockdown-afforded cardioprotective effects. Those results indicate that UCP2 drives septic cardiac dysfunction and that the targeted induction of UCP2-mediated autophagy may have important therapeutic potential.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9786101/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:03:59.365Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:03:59.365Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55248fae9a4c4f652b3beb","title":"Evaluation of the Therapeutic Effect of a Flavonoid Prescription against Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease In Vivo","abstract":"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is an acute, high fatal contagious disease induced by rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) with acute severe hepatic injury and causes huge economic loss worldwide.

Fenugreek&#x2019;s most studied and employed effect is its hypoglycemic property, but it can also be useful for the treatment of certain thyroid disorders or for the treatment of anorexia. The regulation of glucose homeostasis is a complex mechanism, dependent on the interaction of different types of hormones and neurotransmitters or other compounds. For the study of how diosgenin and fenugreek seeds modify insulin sensitivity, we used a rat insulin resistance model induced by high-fat diet. Diosgenin in three different doses (1mg/bwkg, 10mg/bwkg, and 50 mg/bwkg, respectively) and fenugreek seed (0.2 g/bwkg) were administered orally for 6 weeks. Insulin sensitivity was determined by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp method. Our research group found that although glucose infusion rate was not significantly modified in either group, the increased insulin sensitivity index and high metabolic clearance rate of insulin found in the 1 mg/kg diosgenin and the fenugreek seed treated group suggested an improved peripheral insulin sensitivity. Results from the 10 mg/kg diosgenin group, however, suggest a marked insulin resistance. Fenugreek seed therapy results on the investigated anabolic hormones support the theory that, besides insulin and gastrointestinal peptides, the hypothalamic-hypopituitary axis regulated hormones synchronized action with IGF-1 also play an important role in the maintaining of normal glucose levels. Both diosgenin and fenugreek seeds are capable of interacting with substrates of the above-mentioned regulatory mechanisms, inducing serious hormonal disorders. Moreover, fenugreek seeds showed the ability to reduce the thyroid hormone levels at the periphery and to modify the T4/T3 ratio.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the ninth most common cause of cancer death globally. Many studies have investigated aspirin exposure and mortality risk among PCa patients, returning inconsistent results. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to explore the association between aspirin exposure and mortality risk among PCa patients and to investigate potential dose/duration/frequency-response relationships.<i> Methods and Results</i>. Studies published from 1980 to 2018 of PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched. We included 14 studies with 110,000 participants. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using random-effect models. Potential dose/duration/frequency-response relationships were evaluated for aspirin exposure and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) risk. We did not detect an association between the highest aspirin exposure and mortality risk (PCSM of prediagnostic aspirin exposure, OR: 0.96, 95&#x25; confidence interval [CI]: 0.87-1. 07, I<sup>2 </sup>= 0&#x25;; PCSM of postdiagnostic aspirin exposure, OR:0.92, 95&#x25; CI: 0.77-1.10, I<sup>2</sup> = 56.9&#x25;; all-cause mortality [ACM] of prediagnostic aspirin exposure, OR: 0.96, 95&#x25; CI: 0.88-1.04, I<sup>2</sup> = 9.4&#x25;; ACM of postdiagnostic aspirin exposure, OR: 0.95, 95&#x25; CI: 0.73-1.23, I<sup>2</sup> = 88.9&#x25;). There was no significant dose/frequency-response association observed for aspirin exposure and PCSM risk. On duration-response analysis, we found that short-term postdiagnostic aspirin exposure (shorter than 2.5 years) increased the risk of PCSM.<i> Conclusions</i>. Our meta-analysis suggests that there is no association between aspirin exposure and PCSM risk. Nor is there an association between the highest aspirin exposure and ACM risk among PCa patients.

Repairs of large to massive rotator cuff tears have a high failure rate. We investigated the efficacy of a novel, reinforced, low immunogenic, porcine small intestine submucosa (SIS) patch to repair a supraspinatus tendon defect in a rabbit model. We hypothesized that the histological and biomechanical results of SIS patch repair would be comparable with those of autologous fascia lata (FL) repair.<i> Methods</i>. The study mainly comprised two parts. First, the characteristics of the SIS patch were evaluated, including its micromorphology, mechanical properties, and immunogenic properties. Second, a supraspinatus tendon defect model was created in 36 rabbits (72 shoulders). The bilateral shoulders were randomly chosen to undergo repair using either a SIS patch (SIS group) or autologous FL (FL group). At 4, 8, and 12 weeks, histological analysis was performed using four shoulders from each group, and biomechanical tests were performed using eight shoulders from each group.<i> Results</i>. The SIS patch was a three-dimensional construct mainly composed of collagen fibers. The mean single and double suture retention loads of the SIS patch were 48.6 &#xb1; 5.8 N and 117.9 &#xb1; 2.7 N, respectively. The DNA content in the SIS patch was 53.9 &#xb1; 10.9 ng/mg dry weight. Both the histological score and ultimate load to failure increased in a time-dependent manner in both groups, with no significant differences between the SIS and FL groups at 12 weeks.<i> Conclusion</i>. Repair of a large supraspinatus tendon defect using a reinforced, low immunogenic, SIS patch achieves similar effects as autologous FL in a rabbit model.

Three DEmiRNAs (hsa-miR-224-5p, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-miR-31-5p) and five DEmRNAs (CXCR4, SMAD4, KRAS, FITM2, and PLAGL2) were identified key DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs in RSCOAD compared to LSCOAD. The qRT-PCR results of CXCR4, FITM2, TFAP2A, ULBP2, hsa-miR-224-5p, and hsa-miR-155-5p were consistent with our integrated analysis.<i> Conclusion</i>. A total of three DEmiRNAs (hsa-miR-224-5p, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-miR-31-5p) and five DEmRNAs (CXCR4, SMAD4, KRAS, FITM2, and PLAGL2) may be involved in the pathogenesis of RSCOAD and LSCOAD which may make a contribution for understanding mechanisms and developing therapeutic strategies for RSCOAD and LSCOAD.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/7149296/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:04:17.315Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:04:17.315Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5524a1ae9a4c4f652b3bf4","title":"Incorporating Pathway Information into Feature Selection towards Better Performed Gene Signatures","abstract":"To analyze gene expression data with sophisticated grouping structures and to extract hidden patterns from such data, feature selection is of critical importance. It is well known that genes do not function in isolation but rather work together within various metabolic, regulatory, and signaling pathways. If the biological knowledge contained within these pathways is taken into account, the resulting method is a pathway-based algorithm. Studies have demonstrated that a pathway-based method usually outperforms its gene-based counterpart in which no biological knowledge is considered. In this article, a pathway-based feature selection is firstly divided into three major categories, namely, pathway-level selection, bilevel selection, and pathway-guided gene selection. With bilevel selection methods being regarded as a special case of pathway-guided gene selection process, we discuss pathway-guided gene selection methods in detail and the importance of penalization in such methods. Last, we point out the potential utilizations of pathway-guided gene selection in one active research avenue, namely, to analyze longitudinal gene expression data. We believe this article provides valuable insights for computational biologists and biostatisticians so that they can make biology more computable.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/2497509/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:04:17.315Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:04:17.315Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5524afae9a4c4f652b3bf8","title":"Biological Amnion Prevents Flexor Tendon Adhesion in Zone II: A Controlled, Multicentre Clinical Trial","abstract":"<i>Introduction</i>. Tendon adhesion to surrounding tissues is the most common complication reported after tendon repair. To date, effective solutions to prevent tendon injury are still lacking.<i> Materials and Methods</i>. A total of 89 patients with flexor tendon injury in zone II were recruited. The patients were divided into a control group, a poly-DL-lactic acid (PDLLA) group, and an amnion group according to the different tendon treatments applied. The control group was not subjected to other treatments. PDLLA and bioamniotic membranes were, respectively, used to wrap broken ends in the PDLLA and amnion membrane groups. The patients were followed at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery and the ranges of active flexion and extension lag in the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints were evaluated.<i> Results</i>. The means of total active ranges of motion of the interphalangeal joints (excluding rupture cases) in the PDLLA and amnion groups did not significantly differ between each other but significantly differed from that of the control group. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference in the clinical grades of the outcomes among the control, PDLLA, and amnion groups. The incidence of complications in the control and PDLLA groups was found to be significantly higher than that in the amniotic membrane group; no significant difference was observed between the control and PDLLA groups.<i> Conclusion</i>. In this study, freeze-dried amniotic membrane transplantation was applied to promote healing of the flexor tendon in zone II and prevent adhesion.

Seven prospective cohort studies including 645 AF patients were included. Within a follow-up duration of up to 18 months, 244 patients developed AF recurrence.

However, the risk is not as high as other solid organ transplantations (SOT), particularly for skin cancer. The liver is considered as an immune privileged organ since it has a low prevalence of humoral rejection in contrast to other SOT, and thus, LT requires a minimal amount of immunosuppressants compared to other SOT recipients. However, because of the large volume of the liver, patients with LT have higher donor lymphocytes that sometimes may trigger graft-versus-host-disease, yet it is rare. On the other hand, the vast majority of the nonspecific dermatological lesions linked with cirrhosis improve after removal of diseased liver or due to the immunosuppressant used after LT. Nevertheless, dermatological infections related to bacteria, viruses, and fungus after LT are not uncommon. Additionally, the incidence of IgE-mediated food allergies develops in 12.2&#x25; of LT patients and may present as life-threatening conditions such as urticaria and/or angioedema and hypersensitivity. Moreover, skin malignancies after LT are a matter of concern. Thus, posttransplant dermatological care should be provided to all LT patients for any suspicious dermatological lesions.

From 2005 January to 2016 March, 194 ESRD patients underwent radical nephroureterectomy due to UTUC in our hospital. The parameters were obtained from the chart record and pathology report. SPSS version 21 software was used for all statistical analyses. Unequal matching created study groups wherein a 0.2 caliper width was performed for adjusting these confounding pathological factors. Propensity score-matching cohort was performed for each population first, and then for all the study patients. We observed that the average age of UTUC in ESRD patients after KT was younger than in those without KT. The pathological factors such as stage, bladder cancer history, papillary structure, lymphovascular invasion, and variant histology were equal in these two groups. However, younger onset (p&#x3c;0.001), more multifocal tumors, and carcinomas in situ were observed in post-KT UTUC (p&#x3c;0.001 and 0.006, respectively). After adjustment of pathological factors by propensity score-matched analysis, the 5-year systemic UTUC recurrence was significantly more in ESRD after KT compared with ESRD without KT (p=0.03). No obvious difference in 5-year cancer related death could be observed between these two groups (p=0.314). Post-kidney transplantation upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma in Taiwan is relatively common, has younger onset, and is associated with aggressive pathological features. The oncologic outcome of UTUC after KT is poor in our observation, even after propensity scored-matched analysis. It indicates the immunosuppression status is still associated with more malignant UTUC behavior.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/2979142/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:04:46.980Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:04:46.980Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5524beae9a4c4f652b3c04","title":"Transcriptional Regulation of Ovarian Steroidogenic Genes: Recent Findings Obtained from Stem Cell-Derived Steroidogenic Cells","abstract":"Ovaries represent one of the primary steroidogenic organs, producing estrogen and progesterone under the regulation of gonadotropins during the estrous cycle.

The significance of difficult or failed tracheal intubation following induction is a well-recognized cause of morbidity and mortality in anesthetic practice. Nevertheless, the need to predict potentially difficult tracheal intubation has received a little attention. During routine anesthesia, the incidence of difficult tracheal intubation has been estimated at 1.5&#x0025;&#x2013;8&#x0025; of general anesthetics. Difficulties in intubation have been associated with serious complications, such as brain damage or death, particularly when failed intubation has occurred. Occasionally, in a patient with a difficult airway, the anesthetist is faced with the situation where mask ventilation proves difficult or impossible. This is one of the most critical emergencies that may be faced in the practice of anesthesia. If the anesthetist can predict which patients are likely to prove difficult to intubate, he/she may reduce the risks of anesthesia considerably. In Ethiopia, there are no data on the magnitude of difficult laryngoscopic tracheal intubation and no standard guidelines for preoperative tests. The main concern of this study was to provide information on the magnitude of difficult laryngoscopic intubation and to determine valuable preoperative tests to predict difficult laryngoscopy and intubation in patients with apparently normal airways which can help anesthetists to improve preoperative airway assessment and contribute to decrease anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. <i>Objective</i>. The main objective of this study was to assess the magnitude and predictive values of preoperative tests for difficult laryngoscopy and intubation, among surgical patients who underwent elective surgery under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation in Tikur Anbessa Hospital from February 1 to March 30, 2016. <i>Study Design</i>. A facility-based cross-sectional study design was used. <i>Result</i>. In this study, we found the magnitude of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation as 13.6&#x0025; and 5&#x0025;, respectively. 33.3&#x0025; of patients with difficult laryngoscopy were found to be difficult for intubation.

In particular, medical care costs for the elderly is growing at the rate of about 9&#x25; annually alongside the rapid increase of the aging population. In Japan, the specific health checkup and specific health guidance were implemented in 2008 to reduce medical costs in the medium to long term by preventing metabolic syndrome. To evaluate the influence of Specific Health Guidance on medical costs for metabolic-related or other diseases, we conducted propensity score matching and compared between those who received the Health Guidance and those who did not. The two groups were extracted from those with zero outpatient medical expenses for the five months prior to the checkup. The following were selected as variables for matching: gender, age, BMI, abdominal circumference, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, total cholesterol, urinary protein, smoking/nonsmoking, hoping/not hoping for Health Guidance, and willing/not willing to improve one&#x2019;s lifestyle habits. Finally, 50 one-to-one matches were performed between the intervention and control groups. The results of the Tobit regression analysis showed that Health Guidance significantly lowered metabolic-related medical expenses for the 26 months. However, for other diseases, no significant difference for medical expenses was evident between the two groups. The consultation rate of the intervention group after 12 months was 28&#x25; and 46&#x25; for the control group. The results suggest that the Specific Health Guidance in Japan reduced outpatient consultation for metabolic-related diseases.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aph/2019/9735127/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:04:46.980Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:04:46.980Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5524cdae9a4c4f652b3c0d","title":"TFIIIB Subunit Bdp1 Participates in RNA Polymerase III Transcription in the Protozoan Parasite Leishmania major","abstract":"<i>Leishmania major,</i> a protozoan parasite that diverged early from the main eukaryotic lineage, exhibits unusual mechanisms of gene expression.

These DEGs were further analyzed using gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The results showed that the upregulated DEGs were involved in cholesterol synthesis, protein binding, and composition of cellular membranes, mainly enriched in metabolic and biosynthesis pathways. While downregulated DEGs were implicated in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and cytoskeleton and were enriched in ECM pathway.

Patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) who underwent coronary angiography and OCT in our department from January 2015 to August 2018 were included in this study. Coronary lesions were categorized as ruptured plaque, nonruptured with thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA), and nonruptured and non-TCFA.

Interestingly, there are patients with symptomatic OA displaying pain, while patients with asymptomatic OA that do not experience pain but show radiographic signs of joint damage. Pain is a complex experience integrating sensory, affective, and cognitive processes related to several peripheral and central nociceptive factors besides inflammation. During the last years, the role of infrapatellar fat pad (IFP), other than the synovial membrane, has been investigated as a potential source of pain in OA. Interestingly, new findings suggest that IFP and synovial membrane might act as a functional unit in OA pathogenesis and pain. The present review discuss the role of IFP and synovial membrane in the development of OA, with a particular focus on pain onset and the possible involved mediators that may play a role in OA pathology and pain mechanisms. Inflammation of IFP and synovial membrane may drive peripheral and central sensitization in KOA. Since sensitization is associated with pain severity in knee OA and may potentially contribute to the transition from acute to chronic, persistent pain in knee OA, preventing sensitization would be a potentially effective and novel means of preventing worsening of pain in knee OA.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/6390182/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:01.549Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:01.549Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5524cdae9a4c4f652b3c13","title":"Effects of Ivabradine on Residual Myocardial Ischemia after PCI Evaluated by Stress Echocardiography","abstract":"<i>Background</i>. Residual angina after PCI is a frequently occurring disease. Ivabradine improves symptoms but its role in patients without left ventricular systolic dysfunction is still unclear.

Twenty-eight consecutive patients with residual angina after PCI were randomized to ivabradine 5 mg twice/day (IG) or standard therapy (CG). All patients performed a stress echocardiography at the enrollment and after 30 days.

The tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium (NA) channels (Nav1.7) play important roles in the pathophysiology of pain. In this study, we investigated the TG expression of Nav1.7 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in a rat model of pulpitis to explore the correlation between these channels and inflammatory pain. Pulpitis was confirmed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. In this study, we demonstrated that the reflex of rats to mechanical stimulation increases after pulp exposure and that the exposed rat molar pulp can upregulate the expression of Nav1.7 and ERK in the rat TG. Three days after rat pulp exposure, the expression levels of the two ion channels in the TG increased. TG target injection of PF04856264, a Nav1.7 inhibitor, dose-dependently increased the mechanical pain threshold and was able to inhibit ERK expression. TG target injection of PD98059, an ERK inhibitor, dose-dependently increased the mechanical pain threshold. These factors simultaneously resulted in the highest production. In this study, with the established link to inflammatory pain, we found that Nav1.7 and ERK both play important roles in the induction of inflammatory pain caused by pulpitis. We also found a correlation between the expression levels of Nav1.7 and ERK and the degree of inflammatory pain.

With the current therapies combined with chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, the prognosis of hematologic malignancies improved significantly. However, most hematological malignancies are still incurable. Therefore, research for novel treatment options was continuing with the natural product as one source. Icaritin is a compound extracted from a traditional Chinese herb,<i> Epimedium Genus</i>, and demonstrated an antitumor effect in various neoplasms including hematological malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. In hematological malignancies, icaritin showed multiple cytotoxic effects to induce apoptosis, arrest the cell cycle, inhibit proliferation, promote differentiation, restrict metastasis and infiltration, and suppress the oncogenic virus. The proved underlying mechanisms of the cytotoxic effects of icaritin are different in various cell types of hematological malignancies but associated with the critical cell signal pathway, including PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT3, and MAPK/ERK/JNK. Although the primary target of icaritin is still unspecified, the existing evidence indicates that icaritin is a potential novel therapeutic agent for neoplasms as with hematological malignancies. Here, in the field of hematology, we reviewed the reported activity of icaritin in hematologic malignancies and the underlying mechanisms and recognized icaritin as a candidate for therapy of hematological malignancies.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4860268/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:18.352Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:18.352Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5524deae9a4c4f652b3c1b","title":"In Silico Integration Approach Reveals Key MicroRNAs and Their Target Genes in Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma","abstract":"To better understand the molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), this study aimed at identifying key miRNAs and their target genes associated with FTC, as well as analyzing their interactions.

The common DEMs from R and SAM were fed to three different bioinformatic tools, TargetScan, miRDB, and miRTarBase, respectively, to predict their biological targets. With DEGs intersected with target genes of DEMs, the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed through the DAVID database. Then a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by STRING. Finally, the module analysis for PPI network was performed by MCODE and BiNGO. A total of nine DEMs were identified, and their function might work through regulating hub genes in the PPI network especially KIT and EGFR. KEGG analysis showed that intersection genes were enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and microRNAs in cancer. In conclusion, the study of miRNA-mRNA network would offer molecular support for differential diagnosis between malignant FTC and benign FTA, providing new insights into the potential targets for follicular thyroid carcinoma diagnosis and treatment.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/2725192/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:18.352Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:18.352Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5524deae9a4c4f652b3c1c","title":"Nasal Delivery Devices: A Comparative Study on Cadaver Model","abstract":"Nasal nebulization is a more effective method of delivering topical medication than nasal spray.

EBV is known to infect more than 95&#x25; of adults in the world. The virus mainly infects B lymphocytes and could immortalize and transform the cells into EBV-bearing lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Limited studies have been focused on characterizing the surface marker expression of the immortalized LCLs. This study demonstrates the generation of 15 LCLs from sixteen rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and a healthy volunteer using B95-8 marmoset-derived EBV. The success rate of LCL generation was 88.23&#x25;. All CD19+ LCLs expressed CD23 (16.94-58.9&#x25;) and CD27 (15.74-80.89&#x25;) on cell surface. Our data demonstrated two distinct categories of LCLs (fast- and slow-growing) (<i>p</i>&#x3c;0.05) based on their doubling time. The slow-growing LCLs showed lower CD23 level (35.28&#x25;) compared to fast-growing LCLs (42.39&#x25;). In contrast, the slow-growing LCLs showed higher percentage in both CD27 alone and CD23+CD27+ in combination. Overall, these findings may suggest the correlations of cellular CD23 and CD27 expression with the proliferation rate of the generated LCLs. Increase expression of CD23 may play a role in EBV immortalization of B-cells and the growth and maintenance of the EBV-transformed LCLs while CD27 expression might have inhibitory effects on LCL proliferation.

Males were significantly more often current/ex-smokers and had lower HDL-cholesterol and higher atherogenic index. There were no significant differences in NT-proBNP, QTc duration, and parameters of EF and DD.<i> Conclusions</i>. In RA patients with continued low disease activity, a higher burden of atherosclerosis was found in males than in females.

Repeated or continuous chronic psychological stress may induce diverse neuropsychiatric disorders; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we explored the expression profiles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs, along with their biological function and regulatory network, in mice after repeated social defeat (RSD) stress to explore their potential involvement in the development of anxiety-like behaviors.<i> Main Methods</i>. RNA-sequencing was used to screen all differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs between the RSD and control groups. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used for confirmation of the RNA-sequencing results. The function of DE lncRNAs was predicted by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and pathway analyses of target mRNAs. In addition, the functional regulatory network of the target mRNAs was constructed to reveal potential relationships between lncRNAs and their target genes with bioinformatics approaches.<i> Key Findings</i>. In mice experiencing RSD, 373 and 454 lncRNAs, along with 1142 and 654, mRNAs were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. The detailed regulatory network included 126 eligible lncRNA-mRNA pairs. Among them, 14 genes such as<i> Arhgef1, Chchd2, Fam107a, Dlg1, Nova2, Dpf1</i>, and<i> Shank3 </i>involved in neurite growth, neural development, and synaptic plasticity were direct targets of the DE lncRNAs. qRT-PCR of four of the DE lncRNAs and mRNAs confirmed the reliability of RNA-sequencing. GO clustering analyses showed that the top enriched biological process, cellular component, and molecular function terms were synaptic transmission, neuron spine, and glutamate receptor binding, respectively. Further, the top three significant enriched pathways were synaptic adhesion-like molecule (SALM) protein interactions at the synapses, trafficking of <i>&#x3b1;</i>-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, as well as glutamate binding, activation of AMPA receptors, and synaptic plasticity.<i> Significance</i>. Hundreds of lncRNAs and mRNAs are dysregulated after RSD, and many of these lncRNAs might participate in the development of anxiety-like behaviors via multiple complex mechanisms such as target regulation. Available informatics evidence highlighted the likely role of synapse dysfunction and abnormal synaptic neurotransmission in these behaviors. Thus, our findings provide potential candidate biomarkers or intervention targets for chronic psychological stress-induced neuropsychiatric disorders.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/7505260/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:32.198Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:32.198Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5524ecae9a4c4f652b3c24","title":"Haloperidol-Induced Dystonia due to Sedation for Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy: A Pediatric Case Report","abstract":"Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle tone.

This study was designed to map the overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of GIST patients. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program database, we acquired the data of 6,713 patients with GIST who were diagnosed between 2004 and 2014. We randomly separated the patients into training (n = 4,699) and validation (n = 2,014) groups. To assess the prognostic impact of multiple clinical parameters, the Kaplan-Meier approach and the Cox proportional hazards regression model were adopted, where essential prognostic variables were combined to create nomograms. The consistency index and curve of calibration had been adopted to assess nomogram discrimination ability and prediction accuracy. A multifactor analysis of the training cohort showed that age, gender, size of tumor, location, and primary surgery were remarkably related to survival, and these variables were applied to create nomograms. The nomogram demonstrated excellent accuracy in estimating 2-, 3-, and 5-year OS and CSS, with a C-index of 0.740 (95&#x25; confidence interval [CI], 0.723-0.757) for OS and 0.743 (95&#x25; CI, 0.718-0.768) for CSS.

General anesthesia combining with a caudal block (CB) has been commonly performed in pediatric patients undergoing circumcision surgeries. However, some severe complications have been suspected of a caudal block in the combined use. To avoid these issues of a caudal block, this study introduces a novel dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) via perineum guided by ultrasound as an alternative to a caudal block in pediatric circumcision surgeries.<i> Methods</i>. A total of 104 pediatric patients scheduled for circumcision surgeries were involved and randomly divided into 2 groups: the CB group (n=52) and the DPNB group (n=52). A laryngeal mask was inserted followed by induction and maintenance anesthesia of inhaled sevoflurane. In the DPNB group, a dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) guided by a real-time ultrasonography was performed by a single injection via perineum of 0.25&#x25; ropivacaine plus 0.8&#x25; lidocaine with total injection volume of 3-5ml. In the CB group, a dose of 0.5 ml/kg was given via the caudal canal following the same general anesthesia with that of Group DPNB. The time to the first analgesic demand after surgery is the key data collected for comparing between the two study groups. Heart rates and respiratory rates changes before and during the surgical procedure, pain score when leaving the PACU, and the time taken for the first micturition after a surgery were also recorded to analyze the differences in analgesic effects between the CB and DPNB groups.<i> Results</i>. No significant difference in heart rates and respiratory rates was found between the two groups before and during the surgery. Pain scores were similar before pediatric patients leave the PACU. However, the time taken for the first micturition after a surgery in Group DPNB is shorter than Group CB. The patients in Group DPNB asked for analgesics later than those in Group CB. Additionally, no significant differences in adverse effects were noted between two groups except the numbness of the lower limbs occurring less in Group DPNB.<i> Conclusions</i>. The ultrasound-guided dorsal penile nerve block via perineal approach can basically act as a safe and effective alternative to the caudal block in pediatric patients undergoing circumcision surgeries.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cytotoxicity is an important mechanism by which cisplatin kills tumor cells. Glutathione peroxidase family (GPXs) is an important member of antioxidant system which metabolizes intracellular ROS and maintains homeostasis of cells. Altered expressions of GPXs enzymes, especially GPX1, have been described in a variety of human cancers. However, their functional roles in cisplatin-based chemoresistance in human malignancies including non-small cell lung cancer have never been explored.<i> Methods</i>. A panel of NSCLC cell lines were selected for this study. GPX1 expression was detected using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. Cisplatin-induced cell killing was analyzed by CCK8 assay. Intracellular ROS levels were detected by fluorescence-based flow cytometry analysis. In vitro overexpression and knockdown of GPX1 expression were performed using GPX1 expression vector and siRNA approaches. Protein levels of PTEN, NF-<i>&#x3ba;</i>B, BCL2, Bax, and phosphorylated AKT were detected with western blot analysis using specific antibodies.<i> Results</i>. GPX1 expression was upregulated in a subset of NSCLC cell lines resistant to cisplatin treatment. Expression vector-mediated forced overexpression of GPX1 significantly increased cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cell lines, whereas RNA inference-mediated downregulation of GPX1 could restore sensitivity to cisplatin. Overexpression of GPX1 significantly suppressed elevation of intracellular ROS and activation of AKT pathway when NSCLC cell lines were exposed to different concentrations of cisplatin. Activation of the AKT pathway inhibited proapoptotic cascade and subsequently led to cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells. Inhibition of NF-<i>&#x3ba;</i>B by its chemical inhibitor BAY can significantly downregulate GPX1 expression and restore the cisplatin sensitivity of the cell lines resistant to cisplatin.<i> Conclusions</i>. Our findings suggested that overexpression of GPX1 is a novel molecular mechanism for cisplatin-based chemoresistance in NSCLC. GPX1 overexpression blocks cisplatin-induced ROS intracellular accumulation, activates PI3K-AKT pathway by increased AKT phosphorylation, and further leads to cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells.

Aspirin administration reversed these changes except P53 expression. Tartrazine had no effect on lipid peroxidation but altered AA and GSH levels with no reversal by aspirin treatment. Histopathological analysis revealed that aspirin prevented tartrazine-induced damage including increased perivascular space and hemorrhage. These results indicate that aspirin protects the brain from tartrazine-induced toxicity independent of p53 signaling and antioxidant mechanisms.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9096404/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:49.304Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:49.304Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5524fdae9a4c4f652b3c2d","title":"Calcium Dyshomeostasis Alters CCL5 Signaling in Differentiated PC12 Cells","abstract":"<i>Background</i>. Plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (PMCA) is the most sensitive cellular calcium detector. It exists in four main isoforms (PMCA1-4), among which PMCA2 and PMCA3 are considered as fast-acting neuron-specific forms. In the brain, PMCA function declines progressively during aging; thereby impaired calcium homeostasis may contribute to some neurodegenerative diseases. These destructive processes can be propagated by proinflammatory chemokines, including chemokine CCL5, which causes phospholipase C-mediated liberation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from endoplasmic reticulum by IP<sub>3</sub>-gated channels.<i> Methods</i>. To mimic the changes in aged neurons we used stable transfected differentiated PC12 cells with downregulated PMCA2 or PMCA3 and analyzed the effect of CCL5 on calcium transients with Fluo-4 reagent. Chemokine receptors were evaluated using Western blot, and IP<sub>3</sub> receptors expression level was assessed using qRT-PCR and Western blot.<i> Results</i>. In PMCA-reduced cell lines, CCL5 released more Ca<sup>2+</sup> by IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive receptors, and the time required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance was significantly longer. Also, in these lines we detected altered expression level of CCR5 and IP<sub>3</sub> receptors.<i> Conclusion</i>. Although modification of PMCAs composition could provide some protection against calcium overload, reduction of PMCA2 appeared to be more detrimental to the cells than deficiency of PMCA3. Under pathological conditions, including inflammatory CCL5 action and long-lasting Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyshomeostasis, insufficient cell protection may result in progressive degeneration and death of neurons.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9616248/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:49.303Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:49.303Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5524fdae9a4c4f652b3c30","title":"Pretreatment with Gemcitabine/5-Fluorouracil Enhances the Cytotoxicity of Trastuzumab to HER2-Negative Human Gallbladder Cancer Cells In Vitro and In Vivo","abstract":"The effects of standard clinical therapies including surgery and chemotherapy are poor in advanced gallbladder cancer (GBC). There are a few reported cases of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive GBC that responded well to trastuzumab. But trastuzumab has not yet been used to treat HER2-negative GBC. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of different combined therapies with trastuzumab and gemcitabine and/or 5-fluorouracil on HER2-negative GBC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Trastuzumab alone showed almost no cytotoxicity to GBC cells with originally low HER2 gene amplification. Sequential therapy with chemotherapy followed by trastuzumab showed superiority over reverse sequential chemotherapy (<i>P</i>&#x3c;0.05), concurrent combined chemotherapy (<i>P</i>&#x3c;0.05), chemotherapy alone (<i>P</i>&#x3c;0.05), and trastuzumab alone (<i>P</i>&#x3c;0.05) in terms of cytotoxicity. Sequential therapy with chemotherapy followed by trastuzumab nearly completely inhibited cell viability in HER2-negative GBC cells. Similar results were observed with regard to apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that gemcitabine/5-fluorouracil increased the expressions of total and phosphorylated forms of HER2, thus enhancing the cytotoxicity of trastuzumab. In vivo study verified the results of in vitro study by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay and immunohistochemical analysis. Moreover, not only the lightest tumor bearing but also the best survival state was detected in sequential therapy with chemotherapy followed by trastuzumab group compared with other groups. Our in vivo and in vitro data suggest that sequential therapy with gemcitabine/5-fluorouracil followed by trastuzumab represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy against HER2-negative GBC. The upregulation of phosphorylated HER2 and phosphorylated-AKT induced by gemcitabine/5-fluorouracil treatment shows that HER2/AKT pathway is triggered.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9205851/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:49.304Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:05:49.304Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5524fdae9a4c4f652b3c2f","title":"A Potential Prognostic Gene Signature for Predicting Survival for Glioblastoma Patients","abstract":"<i>Objective</i>. This study aimed to screen prognostic gene signature of glioblastoma (GBM) to construct prognostic model.<i> Methods</i>. Based on the GBM information in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, training set), prognostic genes (Set X) were screened by Cox regression. Then, the optimized prognostic gene signature (Set Y) was further screened by the Cox-Proportional Hazards (Cox-PH). Next, two prognostic models were constructed: model A was based on the Set Y; model B was based on part of the Set X. The samples were divided into low- and high-risk groups according to the median prognosis index (PI). GBM datasets in Gene Expression Ominous (GEO, GSE13041) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) were used as the testing datasets to confirm the prognostic models constructed based on TCGA.<i> Results</i>. We identified that the prognostic 14-gene signature was significantly associated with the overall survival (OS) in the TCGA.

The sera from 4 of 236 adult myositis patients were found to carry the anti-EJ using established novel immunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting. The prevalence of anti-EJ in our cohorts is about 1.7&#x25;. The decline of anti-EJ level was detected in two patients during disease remission. Interstitial lung disease and muscle weakness, but not skin involvement, are common clinical features of anti-EJ positive patients. Moreover, using a cytokine profile analyses, we found that the serum levels of IP-10, IL-6, MCP-1, and VEGF were significantly elevated in patients with anti-EJ and gradually decreased during disease remission of two patients, whereas IL-8 level was obviously reduced in these patients.<i> Conclusion</i>. The novel immunoprecipitation assay is suitable to detect and monitor the levels of anti-EJ autoantibody.

Stair climbing can be a challenging part of daily life and a limiting factor for social participation, in particular for patients after stroke. In order to promote motor relearning of stair climbing, different therapeutical measures can be applied such as motor imagery and robot-assisted stepping therapy. Both are common therapy measures and a positive influence on the rehabilitation process has been reported. However, there are contradictory results regarding the neuromuscular effect of motor imagery, and the effect of robot-assisted tilt table stepping on the EMG activation compared to stair climbing itself is not known. Thus, we investigated the EMG activity during (1) a stepping task on the robot-assisted tilt table Erigo, (2) motor imagery of stair climbing, and (3) real stair climbing in healthy individuals for a subsequent study on patients with lower limb motor impairment. The aim was to assess potential amplitude independent changes of the EMG activation as a function of the different conditions.<i> Methods</i>. EMG data of four muscles of the dominant leg were recorded in m. rectus femoris, m. biceps femoris, m. tibialis anterior, and m. gastrocnemius medialis. The cross-correlation analysis was performed to measure similarity/dissimilarity of the EMG curves.<i> Results</i>. The data of the study participants revealed high cross-correlation coefficients comparing the EMG activation modulation of stair climbing and robot-assisted tilt table stepping in three muscles except for the m. gastrocnemius medialis. As the EMG activation amplitude did not differ between motor imagery and the resting phase the according EMG data of the motor imagery condition were not subjected to a further analysis.<i> Conclusion</i>. Robot-assisted tilt table stepping, but rather not motor imagery, evokes a similar activation in certain leg muscles compared to real stair climbing.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9351689/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:04.876Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:04.876Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55250cae9a4c4f652b3c35","title":"Impact of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis Coinfection on the Evolution of Schistosoma mansoni-Induced Granulomatous Liver Injury in Mice","abstract":"The pathogens<i> Schistosoma mansoni</i> and<i> Paracoccidioides brasiliensis </i>share common geographic areas, determining infectious diseases with high mortality rates worldwide<i>. </i>Histopathological and immunological changes induced by each pathogen are well understood; however, the host responses to<i> S. mansoni</i> and<i> P. brasiliensis</i> coinfection are still unknown.

Recent evidence reveals a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in the fine-tuning regulation of osteogenesis (osteomiRs) suggesting that they can be potential targets for skeleton diseases treatment. However, the functions of osteomiRs during differentiation of hAM-MSCs to osteogenic lineage are poorly understood. In this investigation, we discovered a novel miRNAs expression signature corresponding to the matrix maturation (preosteoblast) and mineralization (mature osteoblast) stages of dexamethasone-induced osteoblastic differentiation of hAM-MSCs. Comprehensive miRNAs profiling using TaqMan Low Density Arrays showed that 18 miRNAs were significantly downregulated, whereas 3 were upregulated in the matrix maturation stage (7 days after osteogenic induction) in comparison to undifferentiated cells used as control. Likewise, 47 miRNAs were suppressed and 25 were overexpressed at mineralization stage (14 days after osteogenic induction) in comparison to osteoprogenitors cells. Five out 93 miRNAs (miR-19b-3p, miR-335-3p, miR-197-3p, miR-34b-39, and miR-576-3p) were regulated at both 7 and 14 days suggesting a role in coordinated guidance of osteoblastic differentiation. Exhaustive bioinformatic predictions showed that the set of modulated miRNAs may target multiple genes involved in regulatory networks driving osteogenesis including key members of BMP, TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i>, and WNT/<i>&#x3b2;</i>-catenin signaling pathways. Of these miRNAs, we selected miR-204, a noncoding small RNA that was expressed at matrix maturation phase and downregulated at maturation stage, for further functional studies. Interestingly, gain-of-function analysis showed that restoration of miR-204 using RNA mimics at the onset of mineralization stage dramatically inhibited deposition of calcium and osteogenic maturation of hAM-MSCs. Moreover<i> in silico</i> analysis detected a conserved miR-204 binding site at the 3&#x2032;UTR of TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i>R2 receptor gene. Using luciferase assays we confirmed that TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i>R2 is a downstream effector of miR-204. In conclusion, we have identified a miRNAs signature for osteoblast differentiation of hAM-MSCs. The results from this study suggested that these miRNAs may act as potential inhibitors or activators of osteogenesis. Our findings also points towards the idea that miR-204/TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i>R2 axis has a regulatory role in differentiation of hAM-MSCs committed to osteoblastic lineage.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8987268/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:04.876Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:04.876Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55250cae9a4c4f652b3c37","title":"A Simple Competing Endogenous RNA Network Identifies Novel mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA Markers in Human Cholangiocarcinoma","abstract":"<i>Background</i>.

To observe the effects of resveratrol (Res) on the antioxidative function and estrogen level in an Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD) mouse model.<i> Methods</i>. First, we examined the effects of Res on an AD mice model. SAMP8 mice were selected as the model, and normal-aging SAMR1 mice were used as the control group. The model mice were randomly divided into three groups: a model group, high-dose Res group (40mg/kg, intraperitoneal (ip)), and low-dose Res group (20mg/kg, ip). After receiving medication for 15 days, the mice were subjected to the water maze test to assess their spatial discrimination. The spectrophotometric method was used to detect the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) as well as the malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Quantitative PCR (q-PCR) was used to detect SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA level changes. Western blot analysis detected HO-1 and Nrf2 protein expression. Second, we researched the effect of Res on the estrogen level in the SAMP8 model mice. The model mice were randomly divided into four groups: a model group, estrogen replacement group (0.28 mg/kg, intramuscular (im), estradiol benzoate), high-dose Res group (5 mg/kg, im), and low-dose Res group (2.5 mg/kg, im). The mice were injected, once every three days, for 5 weeks. Q-PCR was used to detect brain tissue mRNA expression changes. Western blot analysis detected ER<i>&#x3b1;</i>, ER<i>&#x3b2;</i>, and ChAT protein expression. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was used to detect the expression of E2 and amyloid <i>&#x3b2;</i> protein (A<i>&#x3b2;</i>) in brain tissue.<i> Results</i>. Compared with the control treatment, Res could improve the spatial abilities of the mice to a certain extent and also increase the expression of SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and HO-1 at the mRNA level (P&#x3c;0.05). In addition, enhanced SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT activities and HO-1 protein levels and decreased MDA content (P&#x3c;0.05) were detected in the brain tissue of the Res-treated mice. The cytoplasmic Nrf2 content in the Res-treated mice was also decreased while the nuclear Nrf2 content and the nuclear translation rate of Nrf2 were increased (P&#x3c;0.05). Res could decrease the expression of ER<i>&#x3b2;</i> in the brain tissue at the mRNA and protein levels and the expression of A<i>&#x3b2;</i> in the brain tissue at the protein level. Res could also increase the mRNA and protein expression of ER<i>&#x3b1;</i> and ChAT and the protein expression of estradiol in the brain tissue.<i> Conclusion</i>. Res can increase the antioxidant capacity of AD models through the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. In addition, Res can enhance estrogen levels in an AD model. These findings provide a new idea for the treatment of AD.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8983752/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:18.985Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:18.985Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55251aae9a4c4f652b3c43","title":"Feature Selection for Longitudinal Data by Using Sign Averages to Summarize Gene Expression Values over Time","abstract":"With the rapid evolution of high-throughput technologies, time series/longitudinal high-throughput experiments have become possible and affordable.

The feature selection process is of critical importance for longitudinal microarray data. In this study, we proposed aggregating a gene&#x2019;s expression values across time into a single value using the sign average method, thereby degrading a longitudinal feature selection process into a classic one. Regularized logistic regression models with pseudogenes (i.e., the sign average of genes across time as predictors) were then optimized by either the coordinate descent method or the threshold gradient descent regularization method. By applying the proposed methods to simulated data and a traumatic injury dataset, we have demonstrated that the proposed methods, especially for the combination of sign average and threshold gradient descent regularization, outperform other competitive algorithms. To conclude, the proposed methods are highly recommended for studies with the objective of carrying out feature selection for longitudinal gene expression data.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/1724898/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:18.985Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:18.985Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55251aae9a4c4f652b3c44","title":"An Inulin-Specific Lectin with Anti-HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase, Antiproliferative, and Mitogenic Activities from the Edible Mushroom Agaricus bitorquis","abstract":"A novel lectin (ABL) was purified from the dried fruiting bodies of<i> Agaricus bitorquis</i>.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) converts glucose-6-phosphate into 6-phosphogluconate in the pentose phosphate pathway and protects red blood cells (RBCs) from oxidative damage. Their deficiency therefore makes RBCs prone to haemolysis. Sickle cell disease (SCD) on the other hand is a hereditary blood disorder in which there is a single nucleotide substitution in the codon for amino acid 6 substituting glutamic acid with valine. SCD patients are prone to haemolysis due to the shape of their red blood cells and if they are deficient in G6PD, the haemolysis may escalate. Reported studies have indicated variations in the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in SCD patients and as such further work is required. The aim of this study was therefore to estimate the incidence of G-6-PD deficiency among SCD patients and to determine its impact on their RBC parameters as a measure of incidence of anaemia.<i> Methods</i>. A total of 120 clinically diagnosed SCD patients of genotypes HbSS and HbSC were recruited into the study. About 5ml of blood was collected via venipuncture from each patient and used to run G6PD, full blood count, and haemoglobin (Hb) electrophoresis tests. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 and Graphpad prism.<i> Result</i>. G6PD deficiency was detected in 43 (35.83&#x25;) of the participants made up of 16 (13.33&#x25;) males and 27 (22.50&#x25;) females of whom 17 (14.17&#x25;) had partial deficiency and 10 (8.33&#x25;) full deficiency.

To infect new species, IAV typically must overcome a number of species barriers to entry, replication, and egress, even while virus replication is counteracted by antiviral host factors and innate immune mechanisms. A number of host factors have been found to regulate the replication of IAV by interacting with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). The host factor PARP1, a poly-ADP ribosyl polymerase, was required for optimal functions of human, swine, and avian influenza RdRP in human 293T cells. In IAV infection, PARP1 was required for efficient synthesis of viral nucleoprotein (NP) in human lung A549 cells. Intriguingly, pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity (PARylation) by 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide led to a 4-fold increase in RdRP activity, and a 2.3-fold increase in virus titer. Exogenous expression of the natural PARylation inhibitor PARG also enhanced RdRP activity. These data suggest a virus-host interaction dynamic where PARP1 protein itself is required, but cellular PARylation has a distinct suppressive modality, on influenza A viral polymerase activity in human cells.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/av/2019/8512363/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:43.331Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:43.331Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552533ae9a4c4f652b3c49","title":"Atorvastatin Inhibits Breast Cancer Cells by Downregulating PTEN/AKT Pathway via Promoting Ras Homolog Family Member B (RhoB)","abstract":"<i>Background.</i> Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in women around the world.

Stages I, II, and III were confirmed in 5 (16&#x25;), 18 (58&#x25;), and 9 (28&#x25;) patients, respectively. Mandible was affected in 23 (72&#x25;) patients. MRONJ was treated in our department by conservative and surgical modality. In this study we found that 65&#x25; of all patients were classified in the cured/improvement group and 35&#x25; in the stable/progression group. The female gender, osteoporosis as primary disease, oral regime intake, shorter period on BPs, earlier stage of disease, and specific anatomic localisation (frontal and premolar maxilla) were factors associated with better response to therapy and favourable clinical outcome. Comprehensive treatment protocol and further randomized studies are necessary for further improvements.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8345309/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:43.331Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:43.331Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552533ae9a4c4f652b3c4c","title":"Stimulatory Effects of Boron Containing Bioactive Glass on Osteogenesis and Angiogenesis of Polycaprolactone: In Vitro Study","abstract":"Polycaprolactone (PCL) has attracted great attention for bone regeneration attributed to its cost-efficiency, high toughness, and good processability. However, the relatively low elastic modulus, hydrophobic nature, and insufficient bioactivity of pure PCL limited its wider application for bone regeneration. In the present study, the effects of the addition of boron containing bioactive glass (B-BG) materials on the mechanical properties and biological performance of PCL polymer were investigated with different B-BG contents (0, 10, 20, 30, and 40&#x2009;wt.&#x25;), in order to evaluate the potential applications of B-BG/PCL composites for bone regeneration. The results showed that the B-BG/PCL composites possess better tensile strength, human neutral pH value, and fast degradation as compared to pure PCL polymers. Moreover, the incorporation of B-BG could enhance proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and angiogenic factor expression for rat bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSCs) as compared to pure PCL polymers. Importantly, the B-BG also promoted the angiogenic differentiation for human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). These enhanced effects had a concentration dependence of B-BG content, while 30&#x2009;wt.&#x25; B-BG/PCL composites achieved the greatest stimulatory effect. Therefore the 30&#x2009;wt.&#x25; B-BG/PCL composites have potential applications in bone reconstruction fields.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8961409/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:43.331Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:43.331Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552533ae9a4c4f652b3c4d","title":"Self-Assembled Nanoscaled Metalloporphyrin for Optical Detection of Dimethylmethylphosphonate","abstract":"The self-assembly approach has been widely adopted in the effort to design and prepare functional materials.

Diabetes is a risk factor for many diseases, including those concerning the oral district with immunological implications.<i> Materials and Methods</i>. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines accessing the NCBI PubMed database. Authors conducted the search of articles in English language. The results of the last 10 years have been considered, which present useful information regarding the oral conditions. A total of 17 relevant studies were included in the review. The study evaluated only papers with specific inclusion criteria regarding oral health.

Hemispheric asymmetry is one fundamental principle of neuronal organization. Interhemispheric connectivity and lateralization of intrinsic networks in the resting-state brain demonstrate the interhemispheric functional organization and can be affected by disease processes.

Voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) was calculated to detect the interhemispheric connectivity, and the lateralization of the resting-state networks was performed to examine the asymmetry of the intrinsic networks of brain.<i> Results</i>. Decreased interhemispheric connectivity was found at visual, motor, and motor-control related regions in children with DCP, while high cognitive related networks including the central executive network, the frontoparietal network, and the salience network represented decreased asymmetry in children with DCP. Abnormal VMHC in visual areas, as well as the altered lateralization in inferior parietal lobule and supplementary motor area, showed correlation with the gross motor function and activities of daily living in children with DCP.<i> Conclusion</i>.

MSI plays a central role in the development of multiple human cancers. In colon cancer, despite being associated with resistance to 5-fluorouracil treatment, MSI is a favourable prognostic marker. In gastric and endometrial cancers, its prognostic value is not so well established. Nevertheless, recognising the MSI tumours may be important for predicting the therapeutic effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Several gene expression signatures were trained on microarray data sets to understand the regulatory mechanisms underlying microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer. A wealth of expression data already exists in the form of microarray data sets. However, the RNA-seq has become a routine for transcriptome analysis. A new MSI gene expression signature presented here is the first to be valid across two different platforms, microarrays and RNA-seq. In the case of colon cancer, its estimated performance was (<i>i</i>) AUC = 0.94, 95&#x25; CI = (0.90 &#x2013; 0.97) on RNA-seq and (<i>ii</i>) AUC = 0.95, 95&#x25; CI = (0.92 &#x2013; 0.97) on microarray. The 25-gene expression signature was also validated in two independent microarray colon cancer data sets.

The burden of Human Immune Deficiency Virus or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is high in sub-Saharan countries including Ethiopia which have over two-thirds of the global HIV burden. Many would argue that consistent condom use is not most effective method for HIV prevention. Condoms offer protection against unwanted pregnancy and some sexually transmitted infections including Human Immune Deficiency Virus, when used correctly and consistently. Inconsistent use of condom by People Living with Human Immune Deficiency Virus or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome on Antiretroviral Therapy will lead to further worsening the Human Immune Deficiency Virus infection epidemic and reinfection with new drug resistant viral strains.<i> Objective</i>. To assess magnitude of consistent condom use and associated factors among HIV-positive clients on Antiretroviral Therapy in North West Ethiopian health center, 2016 GC.<i> Method</i>. An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted, from April 15 to June 10, 2016. A total of 358 patients on ART in Koladiba Health Center had participated in this research. Koladiba Health Center is the first health center in Ethiopia that is found in Debbie district, which is located in north Gondar Zone. Study participants were selected by simple random sampling technique. Data were collected by using pretested structured questionnaires and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Descriptive statistics was computed and binary and multiple logistic regressions were also conducted to examine the effect of selected independent variables on consistent condom use.<i> Result</i>. A total of 358 ART clients participated in the study with response rate of 90&#x25;. Among study participants, 138 (38.5&#x25;) were in the age category of 35-44 years. About 216 (60.3&#x25;) of the participants were female and 325 (90.8&#x25;) were Orthodox followers. Consistent condom use was reported by 130 (55.8&#x25;) sexually active study subjects. Respondents in rural residence (AOR=0.326, 95&#x25; CI: 0.109, 0.973) and sexual partner initiated condom use (AOR=0.031, 95&#x25; CI: 0.005, 0.186) were found to be the independent predictors of consistent condom use.<i> Conclusion and Recommendations</i>. Consistent condom utilization among HIV clients on ART was low (55.8&#x25;). Place of residence and condom use initiation during sexual contact were significantly associated with consistent condom use. It is better to give more emphasis on health education and counseling service about consistent condom use for PLWHA who are on ART during follow-up especially for those who came from rural areas.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/art/2019/7134908/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:43.332Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:06:43.332Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552544ae9a4c4f652b3c53","title":"Oral Applications of Cyanoacrylate Adhesives: A Literature Review","abstract":"Cyanoacrylate adhesives have been used in medicine and dentistry with some controversial opinions.

Human diets dominated by cereal products cause micronutrient malnutrition, which is common in many developing countries where populations depend heavily on staple grain crops such as wheat, maize, and rice. Biofortification is one of the most effective approaches to alleviate malnutrition. Genetically stable mutant spring wheat lines (M<sub>7</sub> generation) produced via 100 or 200 Gy gamma treatments to broaden genetic variation for grain nutrients were analyzed for nutritionally important minerals (Ca, Fe, and Zn), their bioavailability, and grain protein content (GPC). Variation was 172.3&#x2013;883.0 mg/kg for Ca, 40.9&#x2013;89.0 mg/kg for Fe, and 22.2&#x2013;89.6 mg/kg for Zn. In mutant lines, among the investigated minerals, the highest increases in concentrations were observed in Fe, Zn, and Ca when compared to the parental cultivar Zhenis. Some mutant lines, mostly in the 100 Gy-derived germplasm, had more than two-fold higher Fe, Zn, and Ca concentrations, lower phytic acid concentration (1.4&#x2013;2.1-fold), and 6.5&#x2013;7&#x25; higher grain protein content compared to the parent.

A retrospective, comparative study was conducted with the enrollment of 20 patients in each group through propensity score matching in a 1:1:1 ratio from 291 patients who underwent single ESWT for painful shoulder tendinosis. The patients were divided into three groups which included noncalcified tendinosis (NCTS), type I dense calcified tendinosis of shoulder (DCTS), and type II and type III translucent calcified tendinosis of shoulder (TCTS) according to Gartner and Heyer classification. The clinical evaluation included the subjective pain score with visual analog scale (VAS) and functional outcome with Constant and Murley score (CMS).<i> Results</i>. Twelve months after ESWT, the VAS in TCTS (1.5 &#xb1; 2.48) was statistically significant lower than NCTS (2.9 &#xb1; 2.86) and DCTS (3.8 &#xb1; 2.46) (p=.011). For the functional outcome, the overall CMS was superior in TCTS than the NCTS and DCTS (86.9 &#xb1; 19.7 versus 78.7 &#xb1; 18.3 and 71.1 &#xb1; 17.8, p=.014). Besides, the subscales of pain score, strength, and range of motion in TCTS improved significantly better than NCTS and DCTS. 70&#x25; of patients were complaint-free in TCTS group, which was higher than the NCTS group (15&#x25;) and DCTS group (25&#x25;) (p&#x3c;0.05).<i> Conclusion</i>. The present study indicated that the high-dose ESWT posed superior clinical efficacy in type II/III calcification tendinosis rather than type I calcification and noncalcific shoulder tendinosis.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/2958251/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:07:00.420Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:07:00.420Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552544ae9a4c4f652b3c59","title":"Intestinal Perforation in ACTH-Dependent Cushing’s Syndrome","abstract":"Previous studies have linked systemic glucocorticoid use with intestinal perforation.

Of 110 patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome followed in two clinics in Canada, six cases with intestinal perforation were identified over 15 years. Age of patients ranged from 52 to 72, five females and one male, four with Cushing&#x2019;s disease and two with ectopic ACTH production, one from a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and one from medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Five had diverticular perforation and one had intestinal perforation from a stercoral ulcer. All cases had their lower intestinal perforation when the cortisol production was high, and one patient had diverticular perforation 15 months prior to the diagnosis of Cushing&#x2019;s disease. As in previously reported cases, most had hypokalemia and abdominal pain with minimal or no peritoneal symptoms and this occurred during the active phase of Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome. Whereas all previously reported cases occurred in patients with 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels greater than 10-fold the upper limit of normal when measured and 11 of 14 patients had ectopic ACTH production, only one of our patients had this degree of hypercortisolism and four of our six patients had Cushing&#x2019;s disease. Similar to exogenous steroid use, patients with endogenous hypercortisolism also have a higher risk of intestinal, in particular diverticular, perforation and should be monitored closely for its occurrence with a low threshold for investigation and surgical intervention.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disease. It can cause many serious complications. OSA may increase the risk of hypertension. However, the exact mechanism of OSA causing hypertension is not fully understood. YKL-40/chitinase-3-like protein-1 plays an important role in vascular injury, repair, and generation. We sought to explore the role of YKL-40 in endothelial dysfunction and hypertension in OSA patients.<i> Methods</i>. All subjects were examined by polysomnography (PSG) and the expression of YKL-40 in the plasm of the subjects was measured by luminex.

According to the conditions of OSA and hypertension, we studied four groups of 157 subjects, including OSA group (OSA, N=77), OSA with hypertension group (OSA+HT, N=37), hypertension group (HT, N=20), and healthly group (Con, N=23). YKL-40 levels were significantly elevated in OSA, OSA+HT, and HT group compared to Con groups. We used the ROC to predict the sensitivity and specificity of YKL-40 in all OSA patients or all hyperpietic patients.

There is paucity of data on the role of Kiss1 and GPR54 gene in PCOS. We aimed to identify the polymorphisms in Kiss1 and GPR54 genes and explore their association with serum kisspeptin levels among Sri Lankan women with well-characterized PCOS. Consecutive women with PCOS manifesting from adolescence (n=55) and adult controls (n=110) were recruited. Serum kisspeptin and testosterone levels were determined by ELISA method. Whole gene sequencing was performed to identify the polymorphisms in Kiss1 and GPR54 genes. Serum kisspeptin and testosterone concentrations were significantly higher in women with PCOS than controls: kisspeptin 4.873nmol/L versus 4.127nmol/L; testosterone 4.713nmol/L versus 3.415 nmol/L, p&#x3c;0.05.

Many of diseases are spread through water contamination caused by poultry droppings. A study was conducted to compare the intestinal microbial structure of Shaoxing ducks with and without water. Thirty 1-day-old Shaoxing ducks (Qingke No. 3) were randomly divided into two groups; one group had free access to water (CC), while the other one was restricted from water (CT). After 8 months of breeding, caecal samples of 10 birds from each group were obtained on ice for high-throughput sequencing. A total of 1507978 valid sequences were examined and clustered into 1815 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). At phylum level, Firmicutes (41.37&#x25;), Bacteroidetes (33.26&#x25;), Proteobacteria (13.67&#x25;), and Actinobacteria (8.26&#x25;) were found to dominate the microbial community in CC birds, while Firmicutes (53.62&#x25;), Bacteroidetes (33.06&#x25;), and Actinobacteria (11.13&#x25;) were uncovered to be the prime phyla in CT ducks. At genus level, Bacteroides (25.02&#x25;), Escherichia-Shigella (11.02&#x25;), Peptococcus (7.73&#x25;) and Parabacteroides (5.86&#x25;) were revealed to be the mainly genera in the CC group ducks, while Bacteroides (18.11&#x25;), Erysipelatoclostridium (10.94&#x25;), Ruminococcaceae&#x5f;unclassified (10.43&#x25;), Lachnospiraceae&#x5f;unclassified (5.26&#x25;), Coriobacteriales&#x5f;unclassified (5.89&#x25;), and Faecalibacterium (4.2&#x25;) were detected to staple the microbial flora in the CT birds. One phylum and 13 genera were found to have the significant difference between the two bird groups (p&#x3c;0.05). At phylum level, Proteobacteria in CT ducks were found to be obviously lower than ducks in CC birds (p&#x3c;0.05). At genus level, Escherichia-Shigella (p&#x3c;0.05) and Peptococcus (p&#x3c;0.05) were found to be notably lower in CT birds, while Erysipelatoclostridium (p&#x3c;0.05), Ruminococcaceae&#x5f;unclassified (p&#x3c;0.01), Coriobacteriales&#x5f;unclassified (p&#x3c;0.05), Faecalibacterium (p&#x3c;0.01), Atopobiaceae&#x5f;unclassified (p&#x3c;0.01), Alistipes (p&#x3c;0.05), Eggerthellaceae&#x5f;unclassified (p&#x3c;0.05), Prevotella&#x5f;7 (&#x3c;0.05), Rikenellaceae&#x5f;RC9&#x5f;gut&#x5f;group (p&#x3c;0.05), Prevotellaceae&#x5f;uncultured (p&#x3c;0.05), and Shuttleworthia (p&#x3c;0.05) were observed to be prominently higher in CT ducks. In conclusion, the present study revealed the effects of keeping ducks away from swimming with obvious changes in the microbial community. Though higher microbial richness was found in the ducks without swimming, more pathogenic genera including Eggerthella, Erysipelatoclostridium, Alistipes, Prevotella&#x5f;7, and Shuttleworthia; zoonotic genera including Eggerthella and Shuttleworthia; inflammatory genus Alistipes; anti-inflammatory Faecalibacterium genus; and tumor genus Rikenellaceae were examined in these ducks.

In particular, major cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations and cystic fibrosis are absent in the former. Instead, deficiency in solute carrier family 9 sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (SLC9A3) may play a role by generating obstructive azoospermia and degraded epithelial structure in the reproductive tract.<i> Objectives.</i> The objective of the study was to test whether SLC9A3 variants cause Taiwanese CBAVD.<i> Materials and Methods.</i> Six-month-old<i> Slc9a3</i><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212; </sup>male mice were used to evaluate the effect of long-term SLC9A3 loss on the reproductive system. A case-control cohort of 29 men with CBAVD and 32 fertile men were genotyped for SLC9A3 variants.<i> Results.</i> SLC9A3 was expressed and localized in the apical border of the epithelium of human vas deferens and glandular epithelium of the seminal vesicle. SLC9A3 deficiency specifically induces atrophy of vas deferens and unfolding of seminal vesicle mucosa in mice. Loss of SLC9A3 increased the incidence of CBAVD in humans from 3.1&#x25; to 37.9&#x25; (p &#x3c; 0.001). Up to 75.9&#x25; of CBAVD patients carry at least one variant in either SLC9A3 or CFTR.<i> Discussion.</i> Our findings build upon previous data associated with CBAVD pathogenesis.

In developing countries including Uganda, there is scarcity of the literature on <i>S. aureus</i> carriage among HCWs, making infection control difficult. This study aimed at determining the nasal carriage rate and comparing the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MSSA) isolates from HCWs of Kampala International University Teaching Hospital. Nasal swab specimens from HCWs were screened for MRSA using both phenotypic and genotypic methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the MRSA and MSSA isolates was performed using the Kirby&#x2013;Bauer disc diffusion method. Out of the 97 participants, 28 (28.8&#x0025;) participants were nasal carriers of <i>S. aureus</i> of which 13 (46.4&#x0025;) were phenotypically MRSA (resistant to cefoxitin) and 8 (28.6&#x0025;) were genotypically MRSA (had <i>mecA</i> gene).

In this review we primarily focus on the tools and techniques available for accessing gene functions which lead to clear phenotypes in wheat. We provide a view of the development of wheat transformation techniques from a historical perspective, and summarize how techniques have been adapted to obtain gain-of-function phenotypes by gene overexpression, loss-of-function phenotypes by expressing antisense RNAs (RNA interference or RNAi), and most recently the manipulation of gene structure and expression using site-specific nucleases, such as CRISPR/Cas9, for genome editing.

TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i> activation of peripheral lung fibroblasts is indicated as the major cause of tissue remodelling in IPF and is resulting in fibroblast hyperplasia and deposition of extracellular matrix. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators combined with cyclic AMP (cAMP) activators have been reported to reduce proliferation and matrix deposition in other conditions than IPF. Therefore, this drug combination may present a novel therapeutic concept for IPF. This study investigated the effect of BAY 41-2272 and forskolin on remodelling parameters in primary human lung fibroblasts. The study determined TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i> induced proliferation by direct cell counts after 3 days; and deposition of collagen type-I, type III, and fibronectin. BAY 41-2272 significantly reduced TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i> induced fibroblast proliferation, but did not reduce viability. This inhibitory effect was further supported by forskolin. Both BAY 41-2272 and forskolin alone reduced TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i> induced collagen and fibronectin<i> de novo</i> synthesis as well as deposition. This effect was significantly stronger when the two compounds were combined. Furthermore, the TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i> induced expression of fibrilar <i>&#x3b1;</i>-smooth muscle actin was reduced by BAY 41-2272 and this effect was strengthened by forskolin. In addition, BAY 41-2272 and forskolin reduced TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i> induced <i>&#x3b2;</i>-catenin. All effects of BAY 41-2272 were concentration dependent.

Thus, this paper aims to evaluate the hyperglycaemic and hypolipidaemic effects of methanolic extract of<i> A. digitata</i> leaves (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg) in diabetic rats. The extract was administered orally for six weeks in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The treatment with the extract caused a significant reduction in the blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-<i>&#x3b1;</i>), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels by 46.7&#x25;, 46.15&#x25;, 48.91&#x25;, 43&#x25;, 60&#x25;, 66&#x25;, 45.45&#x25;, and 30.4&#x25;, respectively, as compared to the diabetic group after the sixth week of treatment.

Sixty prospective patients (age: 20-50 years) undergoing microsurgical varicocelectomy at a teaching hospital were included in the study. Semen parameters and CDUS were recorded and testicular blood flow was determined as PSV and RI of subcapsular artery and intraparenchymal artery of the testes. Nonparametric statistics was applied to test the correlation/association of the semen quality with the PSV, RI, and other variables. Results revealed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.28; p &#x3c; 0.05) between progressive motility of spermatozoa and resistive index of the intraparenchymal arterial blood flow. Furthermore, it was noticed that the progressive motility of spermatozoa was tended to be negatively correlated (r = -0.236) with resistive index of subcapsular arterial blood flow. In conclusion, this study has revealed that progressive motility of sperms has correlation with the intraparenchymal blood flow of testes. The progressive motility of sperms could be correlated with RI of testicular blood flow.

Innovative Assistive Technologies (IAT) such as electronic reminders and surveillance systems are considered as increasingly important tools to facilitate independence among this population and their caregivers. The aim of this study is to synthesise knowledge on facilitators and barriers related to acceptance of and use of IAT among people with CI and their caregivers. This systematic review includes original papers with quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods design. Relevant peer-reviewed articles published in English between 2007 and 2017 were retrieved in the following databases: CINAHL; PubMed; Inspec; and PsycINFO. The Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used for quality assessment. We retrieved thirty studies, including in total 1655 participants from Europe, USA/Canada, Australia, and Asia, enrolled in their homes, care-residences, day-care centres, or Living Labs. Two-thirds of the studies tested technologies integrating home sensors and wearable devices for care and monitoring CI symptoms. Main facilitators for acceptance and adherence to IAT were familiarity with and motivation to use technologies, immediate perception of effectiveness (e.g., increase in safety perceptions), and low technical demands. Barriers identified included older age, low maturity of the IAT, little experience with technologies in general, lack of personalization, and support. More than 2/3 of the studies met 80&#x25; of the quality criteria of the MMAT. Low acceptance and use of IAT both independently and with caregivers remains a significant concern. More knowledge on facilitators and barriers to use of IAT among clients of health care and social services is crucial for the successful implementation of innovative programmes aiming to leverage innovative technologies for the independence of older people with CI.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9196729/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:07:46.407Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:07:46.407Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552572ae9a4c4f652b3c73","title":"Centella asiatica Prevents Increase of Hippocampal Tumor Necrosis Factor- Independently of Its Effect on Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Rat Model of Chronic Stress","abstract":"<i>Centella asiatica</i> ameliorates memory impairment and induces expression of hippocampal brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) in chronically stressed rats.

Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia treated with brand-name CZP (Leponex&#xae;) for more than a year were included in the study. Then these patients were switched to the similar brand of CZP (Luverina&#xae;). Morning predose blood samples for determination of CZP and NCZP using a HPLC system equipped with a UV detector were withdrawn on both occasions at steady state and under the same comedication. Ninety-eight patients, 22 women and 76 men, took part in the study. Mean &#xb1; standard deviation for CZP and NCZP concentration was 421 &#xb1; 262 ng/mL and 275 &#xb1; 180 ng/mL, respectively. After covariate evaluation, only smoking status remained significant in CZP apparent clearance, inducing a mean increment of 32&#x25; but with no clinical impact. The results obtained with the two brands of CZP should ensure comparable efficacy and tolerability with the clinical use of either product. Smoking was significantly associated with a lower exposure to CZP due to higher clearance. The results obtained with the two brands commercialized in our country hint a bioequivalence scenario in the clinical setting.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/3163502/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:07:46.407Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:07:46.407Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552572ae9a4c4f652b3c75","title":"Wheelchair Tilt-in-Space and Recline Functions: Influence on Sitting Interface Pressure and Ischial Blood Flow in an Elderly Population","abstract":"Pressure ulcers (PUs) result from localised injury to the skin and underlying tissue and usually occur over a bony prominence as a result of pressure, often in combination with shear forces. Both pressure magnitude and duration are thought to be key risk factors in the occurrence of PUs, thus exposing wheelchair-bound subjects to high risk of PU development. As a result, wheelchairs that incorporate tilt-in-space and recline functions are routinely prescribed to redistribute pressure away from their ischial tuberosities. The goal of this study was to analyse the role of full-body tilt and recline angles in governing sitting interface pressure and blood circulation parameters in elderly subjects and thereby investigate the efficacy of tilt-in-space wheelchairs for aiding pressure relief activity. Sitting interface pressure and ischial blood flow parameters were examined in 20 healthy elderly subjects while seated in a tilt-in-space and recline wheelchair. Five different angles of seat tilt (5&#xb0;, 15&#xb0;, 25&#xb0;, 35&#xb0;, and 45&#xb0;) were assessed in combination with three different angles of backrest recline (5&#xb0;, 15&#xb0;, and 30&#xb0;). The results of the study show that when compared to the upright reference posture, every position (except 15&#xb0;T/5&#xb0;R) resulted in a significant decrease in sitting interface pressure. Ischial blood flow also showed significant increases at four different positions (45&#xb0;T/15&#xb0;R, 15&#xb0;T/30&#xb0;R, 35&#xb0;T/30&#xb0;R, and 45&#xb0;T/30&#xb0;R) but only at larger tilt-in-space and recline angles. The results therefore suggest that small tilt-in-space and recline angles are indeed able to reduce sitting interface pressures, whereas changes in ischial blood flow only occur at larger angles. In the literature, cell deformation is thought to be dominant over tissue ischemia in the development of tissue necrosis and PUs. Therefore, together with our findings it can be concluded that frequently undertaking small adjustments in tilt-in-space and recline angle might be important for preventing cell deformation and any associated cell necrosis. Larger angles of tilt-in-space and recline seem to support blood flow returning to the tissues, which is likely to play a positive role in healing damaged tissue.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4027976/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:07:46.407Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:07:46.407Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552572ae9a4c4f652b3c74","title":"Does Pharmacological Treatment Reduce the Incidence of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) after Transobturator Sling?","abstract":"<i>Aim</i>.

A growing body of research has demonstrated that the degeneration of chondrocytes is the primary cause of osteoarthritis (OA). Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) can alleviate the degeneration of chondrocytes via promotion of chondrocyte proliferation and inhibition of terminal differentiation, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. This study aimed to identify the microRNAs (miRNAs) that may target PTHrP and regulate the proliferation and terminal differentiation of chondrocytes.<i> Methods</i>. Bioinformatic analysis was used to predict which miRNAs target PTHrP. We collected human knee cartilage specimens to acquire the primary chondrocytes, which we then used to test the expression and function of the targeted miRNAs. To explore the effects of miR-15a-5p on the putative binding sites, specific mimics or inhibitors were transfected into the chondrocytes. Furthermore, a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and chondrocyte degeneration-related factors were used to verify the possible mechanism.<i> Results</i>. The expression of PTHrP was upregulated in the OA chondrocytes, whilst miR-15a-5p was downregulated in the OA chondrocytes. A negative correlation was observed between PTHrP and miR-15a-5p.

In times of stress, the unfolded or misfolded proteins overload the folding capacity of the ER to induce a condition generally known as ER stress. During ER stress, cells activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to handle increasing amounts of abnormal proteins, and recent evidence has demonstrated the activation of the ER chaperone GRP78/BiP (78&#x2009;kDa glucose-regulated protein/binding immunoglobulin protein), which is important for proper folding of newly synthesized and partly folded proteins to maintain protein homeostasis.

Natural products with lower toxicity and safety are currently sought as a potential source to minimize the effect of the gastric ulcers.<i> Perilla frutescens</i> or Nga-mon (in Thai) leaves are rich in rosmarinic acid (RA), which has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. This study investigates the protective effect of ethanolic extract (EE) and aqueous fraction (AF) from<i> Perilla frutescens</i> leaves, which are rich in RA, on indomethacin- (IND-) induced gastric ulcer in a rat model. The EE at the doses of 50 and 500 mg/kg body weight, AF at the doses of 50, 250, and 500 mg/kg body weight, or famotidine (a standard drug) were administered for 14 days prior to ulcer induction. The ulceration was performed by intragastric administration of IND. Gross gastric ulcers and biological and histological parameters were examined. The pretreatment with AF had more significant effects than EE, including reduced ulcer index, decreased gastric secretion volume and decreased acidity, but it had an elevated gastric pH relative to the IND-induced gastric ulcer. In a histopathological study, the EE and AF decreased mucosal ulcer, inflammatory infiltration, and degenerative lining cells. The IND-induced expression of inflammatory mediators was significantly attenuated with EE and AF. The experiment also remarkably showed the preservation of mucus and apoptosis protection of EE and AF on a gastric mucosal ulcer. The findings demonstrated that the EE and AF of perilla leaves were capable of protecting the stomach against gastric ulcers induced by IND through anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic mechanisms that should be further investigated.

It has been shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve important roles in numerous diseases such as gliomas. lncRNAs can regulate the expression of targeted genes through various mechanisms. To identify a novel lncRNA that may be critical in glioma, the present study downloaded the RNA expression profiles of 171 glioma tissues and 5 normal tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database using the TCGAbiolinks package in R. Then, lncRNAs in the downloaded TCGA data were identified using the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC). Based on the fragments per kilobase million value, differential expression analysis was conducted using the limma package in R. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed, and the area under the curve (AUC) was evaluated using the ROCR package in R. A total of 178 lncRNAs corresponding to differentially expressed genes with an AUC &#x3e;0.85 were selected. Upon identifying the differential lncRNAs, ceRNA networks were constructed with these differential lncRNAs using the starbase database. From these networks, the top 10&#x25; hub genes were selected. In addition, the present study randomly selected 4 lncRNAs for quantitative polymerase chain reaction validation in tissue samples. The results revealed that lncRNA ASB16-AS1 exhibited significantly differential expression in tissue samples and was significantly associated with tumor staging and grading. Furthermore, the proliferation, invasion, and migration of U87MG and U251 glioblastoma stem-like cells (U87GS, U251GS) were significantly inhibited upon inhibition of ASB16-AS1, and the expression of key proteins in the EMT signaling pathway was affected by knocking down ASB16-AS1.

This study establishes that camels in the study area suffer with PPR manifest clinical signs that are mainly characterized by inappetence, loss of body condition, and general weakness terminally leading to diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and ocular nasal discharges preceding death. These clinical signs are similar to those observed in small ruminants with slight variations of manifestations such as keratoconjunctivitis as well as edema of the ventral surface of the abdomen. This shows that camels could be involved in the epidemiology of PPR in the region and that PPRV could be involved in the epidemics of Camel Sudden Death syndrome.

Furthermore, if the identified barriers are not well understood, designing context-specific and effective public health response programmes may prove difficult.<i> Objective</i>. This study reviews the current literature pertaining to healthcare workers&#x27; perspectives on the barriers to providing HIV services to children in the primary care setting in Sub-Saharan Africa.<i> Methods</i>. English articles published between 2010 and April 2018 were searched in electronic databases including Sabinet, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Key search words used during the search were &#x201c;healthcare workers&#x2019; perspectives&#x201d; and &#x201c;barriers to providing HIV testing to children&#x201d; OR &#x201c;barriers to ART adherence AND children&#x201d; and &#x201c;barriers to HIV disclosure AND children.&#x201d;<i> Results</i>. There are various barriers to provider-initiated counselling and testing (PICT) of children and disclosure of HIV status to children, including the following: lack of child-friendly infrastructure at clinics; lack of consensus on legal age of consent for both HIV testing and disclosure; healthcare worker unfamiliarity with HIV testing and disclosure guidelines; lack of training in child psychology; and confusion around the healthcare worker&#x2019;s role, which most believed was only to provide health education and clinical services and to correct false information, but not to participate in disclosure. Additionally, primary caregivers were reported to be a barrier to care and treatment of children as they continue to refuse HIV testing for their children and delay disclosure.<i> Conclusion</i>. Training, mentoring, and providing healthcare workers with guidelines on how to provide child-focused HIV care have the potential to address the majority of the barriers to the provision of child-friendly HIV services to children. However, the need to educate primary caregivers on the importance of testing children and disclosing to them is equally important.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/art/2019/8056382/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:08:15.725Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:08:15.725Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55258fae9a4c4f652b3c8b","title":"Identification and Phylogenetic Analysis of the Complete Chloroplast Genomes of Three Ephedra Herbs Containing Ephedrine","abstract":"Ephedrae Herba and Ephedrae Radix et Rhizoma (Mahuang) have been used as Chinese herbal medicines.<i> Ephedra </i>plants mainly live in deserts and have good governance of desertification.

Morphological resemblance amongst species causes difficulty in identifying the original species of<i> Ephedra </i>herbs.

This study introduced the structures of the CP genomes of three<i> Ephedra </i>species and analysed their phylogenetic relationships. Three complete CP genomes of<i> Ephedra </i>showed four-part annular structures, namely, two single-copy regions and two inverted repeat regions. The entire CP genomes of three<i> Ephedra </i>species in terms of size were 109,550 bp (<i>E. sinica</i>), 109,667 bp (<i>E. intermedia</i>), and 109,558 bp (<i>E. equisetina</i>). Each CP genome of the three<i> Ephedra </i>species encoded 118 genes, including 73 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes and 8 ribosomal RNA genes. Eleven high-variation regions were screened through mVISTA to be potential specific DNA barcodes for identifying<i> Ephedra </i>species. Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony trees showed that CP genomes could be used to identify<i> Ephedra </i>species.

H. influenzae</i> remains an organism of a major public health challenge worldwide despite the availability of the Hib vaccine, particularly among children under 5&#x2009;years. Information on the current carriage status and antibiotic susceptibility is key on proper health-care provision. Therefore, we conducted a study to determine <i>H. influenzae</i> carriage rate and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates among the children. <i>Methods</i>. This was a cross-sectional study conducted between January and May 2018, among clinically healthy children under five years attending Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Clinic in Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH). We carried out standard microbiology methods to culture, isolate, and identify <i>H. influenzae</i>, and then, we tested for their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics following the CLSI standards. <i>Results</i>. Of the 248 participants included in the study, 116 (46.77&#x0025;) were females and 132 (53.23&#x0025;) males and 78 (31.45&#x0025;) were below the age of 3&#x2009;months. Fifty one of the study participants had <i>H. influenzae</i> in their nasopharynx, which represents 20.56&#x0025; carriage (95&#x0025; CI 15.49 to 25.63). There was a general high susceptibility of the isolates to the antimicrobial agents commonly used. There was 100&#x0025; susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and imipenem antibiotic agents, though 6 (11.76&#x0025;) and 4 (7.84&#x0025;) of the isolates showed resistance to chloramphenicol and ampicillin, respectively. <i>Conclusion</i>. The high burden presented by <i>H. influenzae</i> and the resultant impact on child health require much attention to prevention of infections associated with the organism. A well-funded molecular study focusing on typing the isolates would determine the impact of the vaccine, given the carriage rates are still high.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cjidmm/2019/6542919/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:08:15.726Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:08:15.726Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55258fae9a4c4f652b3c8d","title":"Native Aortic and Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis Complicated by Embolic ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction","abstract":"Acute myocardial infarction due to a coronary embolic event can occur as a complication of infective endocarditis in up to 2.9% of cases and can frequently be the presenting symptom.

Globally, anemia, among people living with HIV/AIDS, is a major public health problem. It has a significant effect on the progression of HIV/AIDS to advanced stages and there are a number of factors that often affect anemia. However, there is little insight regarding factors affecting anemia among HIV/AIDS patients in developing countries, including Ethiopia.<i> Objective</i>. This study aimed at investigating factors affecting anemia among people living with HIV/AIDS taking ART drug at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.<i> Methods</i>. A hospital based cross-sectional study design was used to assess factors affecting anemia among people living with HIV/AIDS. Structured checklist was used to gather information from charts of patients selected by simple random sampling method. We analyzed the data to identify factors associated with anemia among people with HIV/AIDS using logistic regression models.<i> Results</i>. A total of 301 selected charts were reviewed. The median age was 38 &#xb1; 10.38. The majority (62.5&#x25;) of the patients were taking ZDV-containing ART drug (ZDV/3TC/NVP). The overall anemia prevalence was 34.6&#x25;, while about 5&#x25;, 15.6&#x25;, and 14&#x25; of the patients had severe, moderate, and mild prevalence of anemia, respectively.

RNase L is activated by viral infection and dsRNA. Because the role of swine RNase L (sRNase L) is not fully understood, in this study, we generated a sRNase L knockout PK-15 (KO-PK) cell line through the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to evaluate the function of sRNase L. After transfection with CRISPR-Cas9 followed by selection using puromycin, sRNase L knockout in PK-15 cells was further validated by agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA sequencing, and Western blotting. The sRNase L KO-PK cells failed to trigger RNA degradation and induced less apoptosis than the parental PK-15 cells after transfected with poly (I: C). Furthermore, the levels of ISGs mRNA in sRNase L KO-PK cells were higher than those in the parental PK-15 cells after treated with poly (I: C). Finally, both wild type and attenuated pseudorabies viruses (PRV) replicated more efficiently in sRNase L KO-PK cells than the parental PK-15 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that sRNase L has multiple biological functions including cellular single-stranded RNA degradation, induction of apoptosis, downregulation of transcript levels of ISGs, and antiviral activity against PRV. The sRNase L KO-PK cell line will be a valuable tool for studying functions of sRNase L as well as for producing PRV attenuated vaccine.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/7398208/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:08:29.020Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:08:29.020Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55259dae9a4c4f652b3c92","title":"HDL Particle Size and Functionality Comparison between Patients with and without Confirmed Acute Myocardial Infarction","abstract":"<i>Introduction</i>. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to be the most common cause of death worldwide, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is noteworthy due to its great magnitude. <i>Objectives</i>. This study was carried out to evaluate the structure (molecular and particle size) and functionality of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) shortly after AMI, in the presence of acute inflammatory response. <i>Casuistic and Methods</i>. A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted between January 2015 and August 2016, with a total convenient sample of 85 patients. The patients’ data were segregated according to the Registry of Acute Myocardial Infarction (REAMI), with 45 confirmed AMI patients. The study groups consisted of patients from both sexes, older than 35 years, presented to the Hospital São Rafael (HSR) initially with AMI clinical symptoms. In addition, 40 nonischemic control patients (CPs), without AMI symptomatology, and according to previous inclusion criteria, were selected for convenience in an outpatient care unit. The HDL particle size was measured by laser light scattering (LLS), after separation of HDL from apoB-rich lipoproteins. The paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) activity was determined in a spectrophotometer by using paraoxon as a substrate. The other laboratory marker information, secondary data, was obtained in the laboratory system. <i>Results</i>.

We tested whether<i> i.v.</i> butyrate administration would (a) positively modulate intestinal defence mechanisms and (b) counteract PN-induced dysbiosis. Male Wistar rats were randomised to chow, PN, and PN supplemented with 9 mM butyrate (PN+But) for 12 days. Antimicrobial peptides, mucins, tight junction proteins, and cytokine expression were assessed by RT-qPCR. T-cell subpopulations in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were analysed by flow cytometry. Microbiota composition was assessed in caecum content. Butyrate supplementation resulted in increased expression of tight junction proteins (<i>ZO-1, claudin-7, E-cadherin</i>), antimicrobial peptides (<i>Defa 8, Rd5, RegIII<i>&#x3b3;</i></i>), and lysozyme in the ileal mucosa. Butyrate partially alleviated PN-induced intestinal barrier impairment and normalised IL-4, IL-10, and IgA mRNA expression. PN administration was associated with an increase in Tregs in MLN, which was normalised by butyrate. Butyrate increased the total number of CD4+ and decreased a relative amount of CD8+ memory T cells in MLN. Lack of enteral nutrition and PN administration led to a shift in caecal microbiota composition. Butyrate did not reverse the altered expression of most taxa but did influence the abundance of some potentially beneficial/pathogenic genera, which might contribute to its overall beneficial effect.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/7084734/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:08:48.049Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:08:48.049Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5525b0ae9a4c4f652b3c99","title":"Introducing of the First DCD Kidney Transplantation Program in Poland","abstract":"In many countries, including Poland, the main problem with transplantation is the insufficiency of organ donors in relation to the demand for organs. Hence, the common aim globally is to increase the pool of donors. The prolonged survival of patients after transplantation, with respect to the survival time of patients on dialysis, makes the search much more intense. After the recourse of expanded criteria donors (ECD), the next step was obtaining kidneys from donors after irreversible cardiac death (DCD). Therefore, based on Dutch, British, and Spanish experience, it can be hypothesized that the introduction of DCD procedures in countries that have not launched these programs and the improvement of DCD procedures may shorten the waiting time for organ transplantation globally. The legal basis for the procurement of organs after irreversible cardiac arrest came into existence in Poland in 2010. Previously, such organ procurements were not in practice. Since 1984, when Poland published irreversible cardiac arrest as a criterion of brain death, it became the only way to determine death prior to the procurement of organs. The aim of this report was to evaluate the results of the first 19 transplantation cases involving harvested kidneys from donors after cardiac arrest, which was irreversible and clinically confirmed, without any doubt as per the ethical protocol of DCD. Understanding, support, and public perception are essential for this program&#x2019;s initiation and maintenance.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/6302153/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:08:48.049Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:08:48.049Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5525b0ae9a4c4f652b3c9a","title":"Long-Term Effects of Myoinositol on Behavioural Seizures and Biochemical Changes Evoked by Kainic Acid Induced Epileptogenesis","abstract":"Epilepsy is one of the most devastating neurological diseases and despite significant efforts there is no cure available. Occurrence of spontaneous seizures in epilepsy is preceded by numerous functional and structural pathophysiological reorganizations in the brain&#x2014;a process called epileptogenesis. Treatment strategies targeting this process may be efficient for preventing spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) in epilepsy, or for modification of disease progression. We have previously shown that (i) myoinositol (MI) pretreatment significantly decreases severity of acute seizures (status epilepticus: SE) induced by kainic acid (KA) in experimental animals and (ii) that daily post-SE administration of MI for 4 weeks prevents certain biochemical changes triggered by SE. However it was not established whether such MI treatment also exerts long-term effects on the frequency of SRS. In the present study we have shown that, in KA-induced post-SE epilepsy model in rats, MI treatment for 28 days reduces frequency and duration of behavioural SRS not only during the treatment, but also after its termination for the following 4 weeks. Moreover, MI has significant effects on molecular changes in the hippocampus, including mi-RNA expression spectrum, as well as mRNA levels of sodium-MI transporter and LRRC8A subunit of the volume regulated anionic channel. Taken together, these data suggest that molecular changes induced by MI treatment may counteract epileptogenesis. Thus, here we provide data indicating antiepileptogenic properties of MI, which further supports the idea of developing new antiepileptogenic and disease modifying drug that targets MI system.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4518160/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:08:48.049Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:08:48.049Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5525b0ae9a4c4f652b3c9b","title":"Shuangyu Tiaozhi Granule Attenuates Hypercholesterolemia through the Reduction of Cholesterol Synthesis in Rat Fed a High Cholesterol Diet","abstract":"Shuangyu Tiaozhi Granule (STG) is composed of two kinds of Chinese medicinal herbs in<i> dioscorea</i>, which are used for managing cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).

This meta-analysis does not support any possible association between T. gondii infection and risk of PD. Researches are still warranted to further explore the underlying mechanisms of T. gondii in the pathogenesis of PD and their causal relationship.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8186017/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:02.203Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:02.203Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5525beae9a4c4f652b3ca9","title":"PLCE1 Polymorphisms and Risk of Esophageal and Gastric Cancer in a Northwestern Chinese Population","abstract":"The reported risk susceptibility between<i> phospholipase C epsilon 1 (PLCE1) </i>polymorphisms and esophageal cancer (EC) and gastric cancer (GC) remained inconsistent and controversial, especially on variants other than rs2274223. The relationship between<i> PLCE1</i> polymorphisms and gene expression is also unclear. Here we conducted a case-control study from northwest China, genotyped seven tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in<i> PLCE1</i> with multiplexed SNP MassARRAY assay. Stratified analysis was carried out and<i> PLCE1</i> expression was evaluated in specified groups with the method of qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Results showed that the minor alleles of rs3765524, rs2274223, and rs10509670 were associated with increased risk of EC and GC. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed protective haplotypes of CCAAGTC and CCAA. By stratification, a more significant association was found in subgroups of male, age &#x2265; 54, tumor stages of I-II and tumor size &#x2264; 5&#x2009;cm, EC and cardia cancer (CC) of stomach, and moderate to well differentiated squamous carcinoma. In addition, a significant association for rs3765524 with noncardia cancer (NCC) and adenocarcinoma which is predominant in China was also observed. Further expression analysis identified that<i> PLCE1</i> was downregulated in NCC tissues comparing to their adjacent noncancerous tissues, and its protein expression was higher in genotype rs3765524 CT/TT than in rs3765524 CC. In summary, our study suggests that<i> PLCE1</i> polymorphisms may affect its gene expression and are associated with not only EC and CC, but also, to some extent, NCC risk in this study population.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9765191/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:02.203Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:02.203Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5525beae9a4c4f652b3cab","title":"Review of the Current Knowledge on the Role of Stem Cell Transplantation in Neurorehabilitation","abstract":"The management involving stem cell (SC) therapy along with physiotherapy offers tremendous chance for patients after spinal cord injury (SCI), traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, etc. However, there are still only a limited number of reports assessing the impact of stem cells (SCs) on the rehabilitation process and/or the results of the simultaneous use of SC and rehabilitation.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic disease that decreases mobility, function, and quality of life. This study introduced the &#x201c;Smart-phone SpondyloArthritis Management System&#x201d; (SpAMS), an interactive mobile health (mHealth) tool designed for AS/spondyloarthritis (SpA) disease management and used SpAMS data to evaluate clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with AS.<i> Methods</i>. SpAMS integrates patient&#x2019;s and physician&#x2019;s portals in a smart phone application. The Chinese Ankylosing Spondylitis Prospective Imaging Cohort was launched using SpAMS in April 2016. Patient self-assessments were completed online at baseline and at every subsequent clinic visit. Physician-reported assessments and treatments were recorded by rheumatologists during each visit.<i> Results</i>. In total, 1201 patients with AS [mean (SD) age, 30.6 (8.7) years; male, 82.6&#x25;] were recruited. Mean (SD) disease duration was 8.4 (6.1) years. Past or current symptoms of acute anterior uveitis (AAU), psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were observed in 21.0&#x25;, 3.7&#x25;, and 9.4&#x25; of patients, respectively. AAU and IBD occurred significantly more in patients with symptom duration &#x3e; 10 years. The most commonly used medications at baseline were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (98.2&#x25;). Patients using tumour necrosis factor inhibitors accounted for 20.8&#x25;, and 66.4&#x25; of patients used conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. At baseline, 57.2&#x25; of patients had inactive disease (ID)/low disease activity (LDA); this rate significantly improved to 79.2&#x25; after a mean follow-up of 13.3 (5.9) months. Compared with relapsed patients, new achievers of ID/LDA underwent more online patient assessments (<i>P </i>&#x3c; .001). Problems solved in SpAMS caused 29.1&#x25; of clinic visits to a tertiary hospital unnecessary. SpAMS saved an average of 5.3 hours and 327.4 RMB per person on traffic expenses; these expenses equalled 16&#x25; of the Chinese monthly disposable personal income.<i> Conclusions</i>.

Distant metastasis becomes the predominant mode of treatment failure in NPC patients. Ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3), an active pharmaceutical component extracted from traditional Chinese medicine ginseng, shows antitumor effects in various cancers. In this study, we aimed to determine whether Rg3 inhibits the migration and invasion activity of NPC cells and to explore the possible mechanisms. Our results revealed that Rg3 hampers cell migration and invasion in both HNE1 and CNE2 cell lines. A reduced level of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 was induced by Rg3 treatment. In addition, Rg3 significantly altered the expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers with increased E-cadherin but decreased Vimentin and N-cadherin expression. Transforming growth factor <i>&#x3b2;</i>- (TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i>-) induced morphological transition and marker proteins change of EMT were reversed by Rg3. What is more, Rg3 suppressed the expression of EMT-related transcription factors, especially the Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox 1 (ZEB1). In summary, our data suggested that Rg3 could inhibit migration and invasion of NPC cells. This effect of Rg3 might be mediated through regulating MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions and suppressing EMT.

Cuban sugarcane wax acids (SCWA) and policosanol (PCO) are mixtures of higher aliphatic acids and alcohols, respectively, purified from sugarcane wax with different chief components. Although it has been known that they have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, physiological properties on molecular mechanism of SCWA have been less studied than PCO.<i> Methods</i>. In this study, we compared antiatherogenic activities of SCWA and PCO via encapsulation with reconstituted high-density lipoproteins (rHDL).<i> Results</i>. After reconstitution, SCWA-rHDL showed smaller particle size than PCO-rHDL with increase of content. PCO-rHDL or SCWA-rHDL showed distinct inhibition of glycation with similar extent in the presence of fructose. PCO-rHDL or SCWA-rHDL showed strong antioxidant activity against cupric ion-mediated oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and inhibition of oxLDL uptake into macrophages. Although PCO-rHDL showed 1.2-fold stronger inhibition against cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity than SCWA-rHDL, SCWA-rHDL enhanced 15&#x25; more brain cell (BV-2) growth and 23&#x25; more regeneration of tail fin in zebrafish.<i> Conclusion</i>.

These enhancements of HDL functionality by PCO and SCWA could exert antiaging and rejuvenation activity.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cdtp/2019/8496409/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:20.082Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:20.082Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5525d0ae9a4c4f652b3cae","title":"Comparison of Chromium and Iron Distribution in Serum and Urine among Healthy People and Prediabetes and Diabetes Patients","abstract":"The effect of chromium (Cr) and iron (Fe) on prevalence of diabetes has received great attention. This study investigated serum and urinary Cr and Fe levels among patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), type 1 diabetes (T1D), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the Northeast Chinese population. From January 2010 to October 2011, patients with IFG (<i>n</i>=12), IGT (<i>n</i>=15), T1D (<i>n</i>=25), T2D (<i>n</i>=137) and healthy controls (<i>n</i>=50) were enrolled in the First Hospital of Jilin University. Trace elements were detected using an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer. Serum Cr levels decreased in T2D without complications, diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), and diabetic nephropathy (DN) (<i>P</i>&#x3c;0.05). The urinary Cr level in T1D was the highest of all, which significantly exceeded those of the T2D groups with and without complications. No significant differences of serum Fe levels were found among all groups. The urinary Fe level of T1D was significantly increased (<i>P</i>&#x3c;0.05). The correlation between serum Cr and serum Fe in T2D was obviously positive (<i>P</i>&#x3c;0.05). One month of simvastatin therapy exerted no effects on serum or urinary Cr and Fe levels.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common nerve entrapment syndromes, which has a serious impact on patients&#x2019; work and life. The most effective conservative treatment is steroid injection but its long-term efficacy is still not satisfactory. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of steroid injection combined with miniscalpel-needle (MSN) release for treatment of CTS under ultrasound guidance versus steroid injection alone. We hypothesized that combined therapy could be more beneficial.<i> Methods</i>. Fifty-one patients with CTS were randomly allocated into two groups, namely, steroid injection combined with MSN release group and steroid injection group. The therapeutic effectiveness was evaluated using Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, and four electrophysiological parameters, including distal motor latency (DML), compound muscle action potential (CMAP), sensory nerve action potential (SNAP), and sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks after treatment.<i> Results</i>. Compared with baseline, all the parameters in both groups showed statistically significant improvement at week 4 and week 12 follow-up, respectively (<i>P</i>&#x3c;0.05). When compared with steroid injection group, the outcomes including BCTQ, DML, CMAP, SNCV, and CSA of the median nerve were significantly better in steroid injection combined with MSN release group at week 12 after treatment (<i>P</i>&#x3c;0.05).<i> Conclusions</i>. The effectiveness of steroid injection combined with MSN release for CTS is superior to that of steroid injection alone, which may have important implications for future clinical practice.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine is a critical approach to prevent HBV transmission from mother to child. However, despite high HBV prevalence, evidence about the preference of women of productive age for HBV vaccine in Vietnam was constrained. This study aims to explore the preference and willingness to pay (WTP) for the HBV vaccine in Vietnamese women in productive age.<i> Methods</i>. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Hanoi in April 2016. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information about respondents&#x2019; socioeconomic status and knowledge about HBV vaccination. A contingent valuation approach was employed to measure the WTP for the HBV vaccine. Logistic and interval regressions were used to determine the associated factors.<i> Results</i>. Among 807 women, 80.8&#x25; were willing to have the vaccine injected which had the average price of 108,600 VND (95&#x25; CI, 97,580 VND&#x2013;119,570 VND). Participants not suffering any diseases during pregnancy were more likely to be willing to pay for the HBV vaccine (OR = 3.41, 95&#x25; CI = 1.73&#x2013;6.70). Not having the antenatal examination at central hospitals and working as farmers/workers were positively correlated with willingness to pay for this vaccine, while the number of children of respondents had a negative correlation with WTP.<i> Conclusions</i>. Our sampled women expressed a high willingness to pay for the vaccine. The price people were willing to pay for the vaccine, however, is equal to half of the actual price. These findings implied needs for better targeted public education interventions about HBV and the involvement of local medical staffs and the media in providing information. Efforts to reduce the price of the vaccine should also be warranted for scaling-up the coverage of this vaccine.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9154918/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:20.082Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:20.082Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5525d0ae9a4c4f652b3cb3","title":"Vasculogenic Mimicry Formation Is Associated with Erythropoietin Expression but Not with Erythropoietin Receptor Expression in Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma","abstract":"<i>Background.</i> Vasculogenic mimicry (VM), as an endothelium-independent cancer microcirculation, has been observed in many malignancies including cervical cancer.

To determine the subchronic toxicity of extract, both sexes of Wistar rats were orally given the extract at doses of 20, 100, and 500 mg/kg once daily for 90 days. No changes in body weight, food, and water intake, motor coordination, behavior, and mental alertness were observed. The significant reduction of white blood cell, platelet, and cholesterol together with increase in MCHC was observed in male rats. The reductions of white blood cell and platelet together with the elevations of hemoglobin and hematocrit were also observed in female rats. However, all changes were in normal range.

Ver3 (Ver3) and<i> Exiguobacterium</i> sp. S17 (S17). Cellular adherence over glass and polypropylene surfaces were evaluated together with the effect of increasing doses and oxidative states of arsenic over the quality and quantity of their biofilm production. The arsenic tolerance outcomes showed that HAAL strains could tolerate higher arsenic concentrations than phylogenetic related strains belonging to the German collection of microorganisms and cell cultures (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, DSMZ), which suggest adaptations of HAAL strains to their original environment. On the other hand, the crystal violet method (CV) and SEM analysis showed that Ver3 and S17 were able to attach to solid surfaces and to form the biofilm. The quantification of biofilms production in 48 hours&#x2019; cultures through CV shows that Ver3 yielded higher production in the treatment without arsenic cultured on a glass support, while S17 yield higher biofilm production under intermediate arsenic concentration on glass supports. Polypropylene supports had negative effects on the biofilm production of Ver3 and S17. SEM analysis shows that the highest biofilm yields could be associated with a larger number of attached cells as well as the development of more complex 3D multicellular structures.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/1231975/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:53.983Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:53.983Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5525f1ae9a4c4f652b3cb7","title":"Integrative Bioinformatics Analysis Reveals Potential Gene Biomarkers and Analysis of Function in Human Degenerative Disc Annulus Fibrosus Cells","abstract":"Low back pain is a major cause of disability worldwide.

Chemotherapy is often necessary for treatment of GC; the FOLFOX regimen is extensively applied. However, multidrug resistance (MDR) of GC cells prevents wider application of this treatment. Ubenimex, an inhibitor of CD13, is used as an immune adjuvant to treat hematological malignancies. Here, we demonstrate that CD13 expression positively correlates with MDR development in GC cells. Moreover, Ubenimex reverses the MDR of SGC7901/X and MKN45/X cells and enhances their sensitivity to FOLFOX, in part by decreasing CD13 expression, which is accompanied by downregulation of Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, and survivin expression; increased expression of Bax; and activation of the caspase-3-mediated apoptotic cascade. In addition, Ubenimex downregulates expression of membrane transport proteins, such as P-gp and MRP1, by inhibiting phosphorylation in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to increase intracellular accumulations of 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, a process for which downregulation of CD13 expression is essential. Therefore, the present results reveal a previously uncharacterized function of CD13 in promoting MDR development in GC cells and suggest that Ubenimex is a candidate for reversing the MDR of GC cells.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4390839/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:53.983Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:53.983Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5525f1ae9a4c4f652b3cb8","title":"Calcium Oscillatory Behavior and Its Possible Role during Wound Healing in Bovine Corneal Endothelial Cells in Culture","abstract":"In epithelial layers in culture, immediately after an injury a fast calcium wave (FCW) propagates from the wound borders toward the rest of the monolayer. We show here that similarly to other tissues, during the FCW in bovine corneal endothelial (BCE) cells in culture many cells exhibit calcium oscillations mediated by IP3 signaling. In this study we perform a detailed characterization of this oscillatory behavior and explore its possible role in the process of wound healing. In previous work we showed that, in BCE cells in culture, the healing cells undergo two stages of caspase-dependent apoptosis, at approximately two and eight hours after wounding. We determined that inhibition of the FCW greatly increases the apoptotic rate of the two stages, suggesting that the wave prevents excessive apoptosis of the healing cells. Taking this into account, we investigated the possible participation of the calcium oscillations during the FCW in apoptosis of the healing cells. For this, we employed ARL-67156 (ARL), a weak competitive inhibitor of ecto-ATPases, and the calcium chelator EGTA. We show here that, in healing BCE cells, ARL enhances cellular calcium oscillations during the FCW, while EGTA decreases oscillations. We found that ARL produces a significant decrease (to about half the control value) in the apoptotic index of the first stage of apoptosis, while EGTA increases it. Neither drug noticeably affects the second stage. We have interpreted the effect of ARL on apoptosis as due to the maintenance of moderately risen ATP levels during the FCW, which is in turn the cause for the enhancement of ATP-dependent calcium oscillations. Correspondingly, EGTA would increase the apoptotic index of the first stage by promoting a decrease in the calcium oscillatory rate. The fact that the second stage of apoptosis is not affected by the drugs suggests that the two stages are at least partially subject to different signaling pathways.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8647121/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:53.983Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:09:53.983Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5525f1ae9a4c4f652b3cba","title":"Optimizing Culture Conditions by Statistical Approach to Enhance Production of Pectinase from Bacillus sp.

However, its exact functions and molecular mechanisms in ovarian cancer remain unclear. In this study, we found that TNKS was aberrantly overexpressed in human ovarian cancer tissues and associated with poor patient prognosis. TNKS inhibition or knockdown not only reduced ovarian cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenic potential in nude mice but also enhanced the drug susceptibility of ovarian cancer cells through arresting cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. These phenotypic changes correlated with downregulation of targets (Cyclin D1, MDR, and MMP-9) of Wnt/<i>&#x3b2;</i>-catenin signaling. Furthermore, downregulation of TNKS suppressed the glucose uptake, lactate excretion, and cellular ATP levels and increased cellular O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates. Molecular mechanism studies revealed that TNKS promoted aerobic glycolysis at least in part due to upregulation of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) via activation of Wnt/<i>&#x3b2;</i>-catenin/snail signaling.

Glioma is the most common malignant brain tumor and the patients are prone to poor prognosis. Due to limited treatments, new drug exploration has become a general trend. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the new drugs C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>17</sub>NO<sub>6</sub> and its combination with Scutellarin on glioma cells and the underlying mechanism.<i> Method</i>. U251 and LN229 cells were administrated with C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>17</sub>NO<sub>6</sub> and its combination with Scutellarin. The proliferation ability of glioma cells was determined by cell counting kit-8, plate clone formation assay, and EdU incorporation assay.

A Retrospective Analysis of 162 Cases","abstract":"<i>Introduction</i>. Nonunions are a challenge for orthopedic surgeons. In hypertrophic nonunions, improvement of mechanical stability usually is the satisfactory treatment, whereas in atrophic nonunions improvement of the biological environment is most important. However, scientific evidence revealed that &#x201c;avital&#x201d; nonunions are not avascular and fibrous tissue contains cells with osteogenic potential. To find out if systemic factors suppress this intrinsic potential in atrophic nonunions, this study compares characteristics of hypertrophic with atrophic nonunion patients.<i> Methods</i>. We analyzed medical records of 162 surgically treated patients suffering from aseptic long bone nonunions. Atrophic and hypertrophic nonunions were distinguished by absence or presence of callus and calcification in the fracture gap. Mechanical implant loosening and patient characteristics such as age, gender, and body mass index were assessed. Fracture classification according to AO/OTA, open and closed fractures, and osteosynthesis were recorded. In addition, comorbidities and allergies between both groups were compared.<i> Results</i>. A higher number of hypertrophic nonunion patients were male with often allergies. Hypertrophic nonunion occurred more often after intramedullary nailing compared to atrophic nonunions. Atrophic nonunion patients being nonallergic were significantly older than nonallergic patients suffering from hypertrophic nonunions. In both atrophic and hypertrophic nonunion patients, age was lower in patients with accompanying injuries compared with age of patients with isolated fractures.<i> Conclusion</i>. Systemic factors influence development of nonunion types. In nonallergic patients, atrophic nonunions occur more often in the elderly. This manuscript is a first step to identify different factors which might influence the nature of nonunion. To enable nonunion treatment which is tailored to individual patient characteristics, further prospective studies with more sophisticated research methods are necessary.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/6407098/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:08.382Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:08.382Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552600ae9a4c4f652b3cc4","title":"Black Rice (Oryza sativa L.)

First, we integrated VAERS content with additional sources of drug and molecular data and examined reaction and outcome occurrence by using disproportionality metrics and enrichment analysis. Second, we reviewed social and behavioral determinants that may affect vaccine pharmacovigilance aspects.<i> Results</i>. We describe our experience in processing more than 607000 vaccine adverse event reports and report on the challenges to integrate more than 95500 VAERS medication narratives with structured information about drugs and other therapeutics or supplements. We found that only 12.6&#x25; of events were serious, while 8.97&#x25; referred to polypharmacy cases. Exacerbation of serious clinical patient outcomes was observed in 8.88&#x25; VAERS cases in which drugs may interact with vaccinations or with each other, regardless of vaccine activity interference. Furthermore, we characterized the symptoms reported in those cases and summarized reaction occurrence among vaccine-types. Last, we examine socioeconomic parameters and cost-management features, explore adverse event reporting trends, and highlight perspectives relating to the use and development of digital services, especially in the context of personalized and collaborative health-care.<i> Conclusions</i>. This work provides an informative review of VAERS, identifies challenges and limitations in the processing of vaccine adverse event data, and calls for the better understanding of the socioeconomic landscape pertaining vaccine safety concerns. We expect that adoption of computational techniques for integrated safety assessment and interpretation is key not only to pharmacovigilance practice but also to stakeholders from the entire healthcare system.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/6576483/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:08.383Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:08.383Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552611ae9a4c4f652b3cc9","title":"Stunting and Overweight among 12-24-Month-Old Children Receiving Vaccination in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","abstract":"<i>Introduction</i>. Malnutrition and obesity are a double burden on children in developing countries and could induce higher risks of noncommunicable diseases in the long term. In the big cities of Vietnam, both issues are present and share the issue of nutrition problems; the prevalence of malnutrition in children is gradually decreasing while the prevalence of obesity is increasing rapidly. The paper aims to identify the prevalence of stunting and overweight/obesity in apparently healthy young children in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC).<i> Methods</i>. A prospective cross-sectional study recruited 12-24-month-old children receiving national vaccination in community health centers in HCMC from February 2016 to July 2017. Sixteen healthcare centers were randomly selected among 8 districts of HCMC. Stunting and overweight were defined by height-for-age z-score &#x3c;-2 SD and BMI z-score &#x2265;+2 SD.<i> Results</i>. A total of 768 children had mean age of 16.8&#xb1;4.2 months old, 51.7&#x25; boys. The prevalence of stunting and overweight/obesity was 8.2&#x25; and 10.7&#x25;, respectively. Stunting was associated with older age, boys, and low birth weight of children and occupation of mothers (P &#x3c;0.05). No associated risk factor was observed for overweight/ obesity status.<i> Conclusion</i>. The prevalence of overweight/obesity was higher than the prevalence of stunting in 12-24-month-old children in HCMC. Overweight/obesity would be a public health problem for children in big cities.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/1547626/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:25.666Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:25.666Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552611ae9a4c4f652b3cca","title":"Correlates of Physical Activity of Students in Secondary School Physical Education: A Systematic Review of Literature","abstract":"<i>Background and Objective</i>. Several reviews have summarised studies on secondary school students&#x2019; moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in physical education (PE), but no systematic review with semiquantitative assessment has been conducted to specifically identify the correlates of their MVPA. This review aims to systematically summarise the existing literature, which investigated correlates of MVPA of secondary school students during their PE lessons.<i> Methods</i>. A systematic search using ERIC, SPORTDiscus, PubMed, PsycINFO, Academic Search Premier, and Web of Science was conducted to identify the correlates of the MVPA of secondary school students in PE. Studies were eligible if they were English published articles and examined the association with MVPA during secondary school PE lessons and cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal quantitative studies. Two reviewers independently examined the articles, assessed their methodological quality, and performed data extraction. The correlates of MVPA were synthesised and further assessed semiquantitatively.<i> Results</i>. Fifty-five studies were identified to correlate with secondary school students&#x2019; MVPA in PE lessons. Further analysis only included 43 studies (78.2&#x25;) that were of medium and high quality by methodological quality assessment. Out of 54 variables identified from these medium and high-quality studies, 11 were consistently associated with the MVPA. Sex (boys), ethnicity (White), class gender (boys-only), PE activities (team games), lesson location (outdoors), expectancy beliefs, subjective task values, and enjoyment were consistently and positively associated with MVPA. Other variables, namely, class gender (girls-only), PE activities (movement activities), and lesson context (knowledge), were consistently and negatively related to MVPA.<i> Conclusions</i>. Interventions focusing on the consistent variables are needed to build active lesson time in PE.

Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent demonstrating significant antitumor efficacy. Unlike conventional anticancer agents which are immunosuppressive, oxaliplatin has the capacity to stimulate immunological effects in response to the presentation of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) elicited upon cell death. However, the effects of oxaliplatin treatment on systemic immune responses remain largely unknown. Aims of this study were to investigate the effects of oxaliplatin treatment on the proportions of (1) splenic T cells, B cells, macrophages, pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines, gene expression of splenic cytokines, chemokines, and mediators; (2) double-positive and single-positive CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T thymocytes; (3) bone-marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.<i> Methods</i>. Male BALB/c mice received intraperitoneal injections of oxaliplatin (3mg/kg/d) or sterile water tri-weekly for 2 weeks. Leukocyte populations within the spleen, thymus, and bone-marrow were assessed using flow cytometry. RT-PCR was performed to characterise changes in splenic inflammation-associated genes.<i> Results</i>. Oxaliplatin treatment reduced spleen size and cellularity (CD45<sup>+</sup> cells), increased the proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and Treg cells, and elevated TNF-<i>&#x3b1;</i> expression. Oxaliplatin was selectively cytotoxic to B cells but had no effect on splenic macrophages. Oxaliplatin treatment altered the gene expression of several cytokines, chemokines, and cell mediators. Oxaliplatin did not deplete double-positive thymocytes but increased the single-positive CD8<sup>+</sup> subset. There was also an increase in activated (CD69<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Bone-marrow hematopoietic progenitor pool was demonstrably normal following oxaliplatin treatment when compared to the vehicle-treated cohort.<i> Conclusion</i>. Oxaliplatin does not cause systemic immunosuppression and, instead, has the capacity to induce beneficial antitumor immune responses.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4650695/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:25.667Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:25.667Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552611ae9a4c4f652b3ccd","title":"Association Study of Myosin Heavy Chain 15 Polymorphisms with Asthma Susceptibility in Chinese Han","abstract":"<i>Background</i>.

The patients were randomly assigned into derivation cohort (801cases) and validation cohort (200 cases) in 8:2 ratio, respectively, in which in derivation cohort we found that 7 predictors, including LDH &#x3e;350U/L, HR&#x3e;130 times/min, room air PaO<sub>2</sub> &#x3c;70mmHg, later admission to ICU, Anemia (HGB&#x2264;90g/L), CD4&#x3c;50cells/ul, and development of a pneumothorax, were associated with poor prognosis in HIV/AIDS patients with PCP and were included in the predictive model. The model had excellent discrimination with AUC of 0.904 and 0.921 in derivation and validation cohort, respectively. The predicted scores were divided into two groups to assess the in-hospital mortality risk: low-risk group (0-11 points with mortality with 2.15-12.77&#x25;) and high-risk group (12-21 points with mortality with 38.78&#x25;-81.63&#x25;). The cumulative mortality rate also indicated significant difference between two groups with Kaplan-Meier curve (<i>p</i>&#x3c;0.001). A predictive model to evaluate mortality in HIV/AIDS patients with PCP was constructed based on routine laboratory and clinical parameters, which may be a simple tool for physicians to assess the prognosis in HIV/AIDS patients with PCP in China.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/6057028/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:41.551Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:41.551Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552621ae9a4c4f652b3cd7","title":"Killing Two Angry Birds with One Stone: Autophagy Activation by Inhibiting Calpains in Neurodegenerative Diseases and Beyond","abstract":"Proteolytic machineries execute vital cellular functions and their disturbances are implicated in diverse medical conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases.

In sub-Saharan Africa, very little research has been done on the pneumococcus in relation to people with HIV infection in the era of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. This study investigated pneumococcal carriage among HIV/AIDS patients in southern Ghana to determine the prevalence, risk factors, serotypes and antibiotic resistance of the organism. This was a cross sectional study involving 245 HIV/AIDS patients recruited from Korle Bu Teaching Hospital and Princess Marie Louis Hospital in Accra from November 2016 to March 2017. Epidemiological data on demographic, household and clinical features of the study participants were collected. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were also collected from the study participants and cultured for<i> Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>; the isolates were serotyped by latex agglutination and Quellung reaction. Antimicrobial disc susceptibility was performed on the isolates, and antibiotics tested included tetracycline, erythromycin, cotrimoxazole, levofloxacin, oxacillin and ceftriaxone. Prevalence of pneumococcal carriage among the study participants was 11&#x25; (95&#x25; CI: 7.4 to 15.6); carriage among children and adults was 25&#x25; (95&#x25; CI: 14&#x25; to 38.9&#x25;) and 7.3&#x25; (95&#x25; CI: 4&#x25; to 11.9&#x25;) respectively. School attendance (p=0.001) and history of pneumococcal disease in the past year (p=0.001) were significantly associated with pneumococcal carriage. The most prevalent pneumococcal serotypes carried by the study participants were 19A (15.4&#x25;) and 23F (15.4&#x25;). Serotype coverage of the various pneumococcal vaccines were PCV10 (23.1&#x25;), PCV13 (42.3&#x25;) and PPV23 (50&#x25;). The prevalence of pneumococcal multidrug resistance was 18.5&#x25;. In conclusion, pneumococcal carriage among HIV-infected children was three-fold higher compared to carriage among HIV-infected adults.

Far less is known about the quality of newly formed callus tissues, such as tissue distribution and arrangement within the callus. The aim of this current study was to investigate the effect of cyclic, axial dynamisation on the quantity and quality of callus in an established delayed fracture healing model. In 41 sheep transverse osteotomies with a gap size of 3 mm were stabilised with a unilateral external fixator. In 32 of these, fracture ends were axially stimulated with displacement amplitudes of 0.8 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.2 mm, or 0.0 mm, respectively, for six weeks. In the remaining 9 sheep of the control group, an additional external fixator was mounted to achieve almost total rigidity. Animal material originating from a past animal experiment was reanalysed in this study. Histological thin-ground sections were histomorphometrically analysed regarding the histological structure and composition of the defect region. A slight tendency towards an increase in size of total callus area, area of new bone (nB.Ar), and cartilage (Cg.Ar) was detected with increasing displacement amplitudes compared to the control group. At the anterior callus side nB.Ar and Cg.Ar were significantly larger than at the posterior side in all groups independent of treatment. Regarding the quality of callus, areas of very compact bone were predominant in the treatment groups whereas in the control group a slight shift to more porous bone was observed. No difference of callus compactness was observed between the anterior and the posterior side. The established method to assess the local compactness of callus areas is a useful tool to quantitatively determine the spatial distribution of new bone tissue within the callus. The application of this method in combination with biomechanical testing might reveal interesting relations between tissue distribution and bone strength that, with traditional histomorphometry, cannot be identified.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4250940/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:41.551Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:41.551Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552631ae9a4c4f652b3cdd","title":"A Systematic Review of Potential Therapeutic Use of Lycium Barbarum Polysaccharides in Disease","abstract":"<i>Objective.</i> To evaluate the effect of<i> Lycium barbarum</i> polysaccharides in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases of different etiologies and systems.<i> Methods.</i> We performed an Entrez PubMed literature search using keywords “lycium”, “barbarum”, “polysaccharides”, “anti-fibrotic”, “anti-apoptotic”, “anti-oxidizing”, “anti-aging”, “neuroprotection”, “metabolism”, “diabetes”, “hyperlipidemia”, “neuroprotection”, and “immunomodulation” on the <svg xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"vertical-align:-0.04980087pt\" id=\"M1\" height=\"12.2075pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"-0.0498162 -12.1577 20.989 12.2075\" width=\"20.989pt\"><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,0,0)\"><path id=\"g113-50\" d=\"M384 0V27C293 34 287 42 287 114V635C232 613 172 594 109 583V559L157 557C201 555 205 550 205 499V114C205 42 199 34 109 27V0H384Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,6.24,0)\"><path id=\"g113-53\" d=\"M456 178V225H360V632H320C217 496 115 347 20 206V178H280V106C280 40 276 34 189 27V0H445V27C364 34 360 39 360 106V178H456ZM280 225H82C149 335 214 431 278 520H280V225Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.0091,0,0,-0.0091,12.527,-5.741)\"><path id=\"g58-114\" d=\"M303 37L293 66C280 59 256 49 231 49S173 63 173 143V396H281C294 404 298 428 287 439H173V575L158 577L92 509V439H46L17 408L22 396H92V107C92 27 128 -12 192 -12C203 -12 218 -9 237 2L303 37Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.0091,0,0,-0.0091,15.412,-5.741)\"><path id=\"g58-102\" d=\"M522 0V30C462 35 455 41 455 106V280C455 397 397 451 314 451C262 451 206 414 171 379V710C131 698 69 682 20 675V647C87 642 90 637 90 574V106C90 41 80 35 20 30V0H236V30C176 35 171 43 171 106V339C198 371 237 391 276 391C341 391 374 350 374 269V106C374 43 367 35 308 30V0H522Z\"/></g></svg> of August 2018, resulting in 207 papers, of which 20 were chosen after filtering for ‘English language’ and ‘published within 10 years’ as well as curation for relevance by the authors.<i> Results.</i> The 20 selected papers included 2 randomized control trials (1 double-blinded RCT and 1 double-blinded placebo-controlled RCT), 11 in vivo studies, 5 in vitro studies, 1 study with both in vivo and in vitro results, and 1 chemical study.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term disorder significantly impairing the somatic, emotional, and psychological functioning of its sufferers. Previous research has shown that affected individuals are characterized by an increased level of anxiety and depression. Currently, there are two main treatment schemes for RA; the first uses anti-inflammatory drugs, and the second utilizes biologic agents. This begs the question whether sufferers differ in intensities of pain, anxiety, and depression depending on the type of treatment and what the determinants of these affective states in patients treated using different methods are.<i> Methods</i>.

Research participants filled out a set of questionnaires measuring levels of anxiety and depression, intensity of experienced pain, strategies of coping with pain, and ego resiliency.<i> Results</i>. The collected data was analyzed through intergroup comparisons, calculating simple correlation coefficients, developing and solving regression equations. The results imply that the choice of treatment differentiates the intensity of pain experienced by patients. Those receiving biologic agents reported lower levels of pain compared to those taking anti-inflammatory medication. It has also been noted that there are distinct configurations of conditions conducive to anxiety and depression in both anti-inflammatory and biologic agent groups.<i> Discussion</i>.

CCK8 assay was used to measure cell viability rate of K562/ADR. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, cell cycle distribution, cell apoptosis were measured with flow cytometry, respectively. Proteins related to apoptosis were measured by Western blot. Intracellular Adriamycin accumulation was observed by confocal microscopy and measured by flow cytometry.<i> Results</i>. In vitro study showed intracellular Adriamycin accumulation was remarkably increased by UA. Cell viability treated with Adr (4 <i>&#x3bc;</i>M) was decreased from 89.8&#x25;&#x2009;&#x2009;&#xb1; 4.7 to 32&#x25;&#x2009;&#x2009;&#xb1; 8.9 by combined with UA (4 <i>&#x3bc;</i>M). Adr-induced apoptosis and G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> phase cell cycle arrest were remarkably increased by UA, as well as, intracellular ROS level. However, MDR reversing activity of UA was inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger.<i> Conclusion</i>. These data provide compelling evidence that UA is a promising agent against MDR in leukemia cell line and suggest a promising therapeutic approach for leukemia.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8727935/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:57.124Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:57.124Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552631ae9a4c4f652b3ce4","title":"White Ginseng Ameliorates Depressive Behavior and Increases Hippocampal 5-HT Level in the Stressed Ovariectomized Rats","abstract":"Postmenopausal depression is closely associated with depletion of estrogen which modulates transmission of 5-HT, a key neurotransmitter that regulates stress-managing circuits in the brain. In this study, antidepressive efficacy of white ginseng (<i>Panax gingseng Meyer, </i>WG) was evaluated in stressed ovariectomized rats. Female Sprague Dawley rats were ovariectomized and repeatedly restraint stressed for 2 weeks (2h/day). Thirty minutes before restraint stress, rats were administered saline (control), WG 200 mg/kg (p.o.), WG 400 mg/kg (p.o.), or fluoxetine (PC, 10 mg/kg, i.p.). Tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) were performed to assess antidepressant effect of WG. After behavioral tests, levels of serum corticosterone (CORT) and hippocampal 5-HT were measured. Significant decrease of immobility time in TST and FST was shown in rats administered with PC or WG 400 compared to the control. WG200-treated rats showed remarkable reduction in immobility time of TST. PC, WG 200, or WG 400-administred group exhibited significant reduction of CORT compared to the control. PC or WG-treated rats exhibited remarkable increase in hippocampal 5-HT concentration compared to the control. Hippocampal 5-HT levels in WG groups were higher than those in the PC group. The present study demonstrated that WG had antidepressant efficacy in an animal model of menopausal depression. Treatment with WG enhanced hippocampal 5-HT level while suppressing depressive symptom and serum CORT level. These results provide evidence that WG plays an important role in activating serotonergic neurons in stressful situation, suggesting that WG might be a reliable natural alternative of antidepressant drugs to treat menopausal depression.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/5705232/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:57.124Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:10:57.124Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552631ae9a4c4f652b3ce6","title":"A Genetic Variant in GPR126 Causing a Decreased Inclusion of Exon 6 Is Associated with Cartilage Development in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Population","abstract":"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common spinal deformity disease in adolescents but its etiology and pathogenesis are still unclear. The current study aims to identify the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of G protein-coupled receptor 126 (GPR126) gene and AIS predisposition. GPR126 contains 26 exons and alternative splicing of exon 6 and exon 25 produces 4 protein-coding transcripts. We genotyped SNPs of GPR126 gene around exon 6 and exon 25 in 131 Chinese AIS patients and 132 healthy controls and provided evidence that SNP rs41289839 G&gt;A is strongly associated with AIS susceptibility. Linkage disequilibrium analysis suggests that rs41289839 and other AIS-related SNPs were in strong LD. Next, we demonstrated that rs41289839 G&gt;A inhibits the inclusion of exon 6 during alternative splicing, resulting in a decreased expression level of exon 6-included transcript (GPR126-<span class=\"nowrap\"><svg xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"vertical-align:-0.2454996pt\" id=\"M1\" height=\"11.773pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"-0.0498162 -11.5275 39.7231 11.773\" width=\"39.7231pt\"><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,0,0)\"><path id=\"g121-99\" d=\"M380 106C343 72 306 56 265 56C195 56 116 112 115 248C235 252 361 262 377 265C396 269 400 277 400 297C400 374 333 449 250 449H249C198 449 144 421 103 376S37 269 37 201C37 88 109 -12 232 -12C263 -12 332 6 395 84L380 106ZM225 412C281 412 315 364 314 312C314 297 308 292 290 292C232 290 176 289 120 289C135 370 180 412 225 412Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,5.525,0)\"><path id=\"g121-118\" d=\"M474 0V26C414 34 401 43 364 100L267 248C300 297 324 332 345 358C381 400 394 405 455 411V437H272V411C316 406 323 401 305 370C287 337 267 306 247 276L188 369C169 397 173 405 215 411V437H16V411C71 404 83 396 114 348L201 212C171 167 144 127 116 92C77 42 66 34 4 26V0H190V26C139 34 136 43 156 77C175 113 198 150 220 183L294 66C311 39 302 31 260 26V0H474Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,11.583,0)\"><path id=\"g121-109\" d=\"M257 449C165 449 37 374 37 209C37 98 119 -12 256 -12C355 -12 473 65 473 226C473 349 381 449 257 449ZM244 416C333 416 380 320 380 204C380 67 329 21 267 21C184 21 130 115 130 241C130 354 184 416 244 416Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,18.056,0)\"><path id=\"g121-108\" d=\"M524 0V26C466 32 460 36 460 104V297C460 393 411 449 331 449C302 449 276 437 248 419C223 402 201 387 181 372V451C137 432 90 420 42 411V388C96 378 102 374 102 310V104C102 38 97 33 29 26V0H246V26C187 32 181 36 181 104V339C211 365 250 390 290 390C357 390 381 345 381 276V109C381 40 374 32 315 26V0H524Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,25.167,0)\"><path id=\"g113-55\" d=\"M137 343C167 482 260 545 321 574C357 591 397 603 429 609L423 641C382 634 335 622 295 608C189 570 37 457 37 238C37 84 125 -12 242 -12C362 -12 447 89 447 209C447 311 374 393 267 393C247 393 226 386 204 376L137 343ZM227 337C318 337 361 256 361 173C361 105 336 22 258 22C176 22 126 120 126 240C126 266 127 291 132 310C155 323 189 337 227 337Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.0091,0,0,-0.0091,31.407,-5.741)\"><path id=\"g58-103\" d=\"M138 535C169 535 191 560 191 589C191 620 168 644 139 644S85 620 85 589C85 560 110 535 138 535ZM257 0V30C192 35 185 43 185 109V453C142 435 94 422 40 414V386C101 378 104 372 104 311V109C104 41 97 35 33 30V0H257Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.0091,0,0,-0.0091,33.91,-5.741)\"><path id=\"g58-108\" d=\"M532 0V30C473 38 467 38 467 107V298C467 395 416 451 336 451C307 451 279 439 251 420C226 404 205 389 185 374V453C142 434 94 422 43 413V386C98 378 104 373 104 309V107C104 41 100 38 31 30V0H251V30C191 35 185 40 185 107V337C216 364 255 389 295 389C360 389 386 347 386 276V110C386 44 380 35 321 30V0H532Z\"/></g></svg>)</span> relative to the exon 6 excluded transcript (GPR126-<span class=\"nowrap\"><svg xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"vertical-align:-0.2455101pt\" id=\"M2\" height=\"10.1334pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"-0.0498162 -9.88789 40.4903 10.1334\" width=\"40.4903pt\"><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,0,0)\"><use xlink:href=\"#g121-99\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,5.525,0)\"><use xlink:href=\"#g121-118\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,11.583,0)\"><use xlink:href=\"#g121-109\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,18.056,0)\"><use xlink:href=\"#g121-108\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,25.167,0)\"><use xlink:href=\"#g113-55\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.0091,0,0,-0.0091,31.407,-5.741)\"><path id=\"g58-99\" d=\"M384 109C349 76 310 59 268 59C197 59 123 113 120 245C240 248 367 259 384 262C403 266 407 275 407 296C407 376 338 451 254 451H253C201 451 148 425 105 378C65 334 39 272 39 203C39 88 112 -12 235 -12C266 -12 339 5 402 84L384 109ZM230 411C285 411 319 365 319 313C319 298 313 293 294 293C236 291 180 290 125 290C141 370 185 411 230 411Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.0091,0,0,-0.0091,35.357,-5.741)\"><path id=\"g58-118\" d=\"M482 0V30C420 38 407 48 370 103L273 248C308 299 331 332 352 357C387 397 401 404 463 409V439H277V409C318 405 324 400 307 369C290 337 270 307 251 279L194 367C175 396 180 402 220 409V439H18V409C74 401 87 395 117 349L204 213C173 168 147 130 119 95C78 46 67 38 5 30V0H195V30C144 38 143 47 162 79C181 112 202 149 225 181L297 70C314 43 307 35 264 30V0H482Z\"/></g></svg>)</span> by minigene assay.

Radical or combined radical surgery for thyroid cancer was performed in 82 patients with thyroid cancer and 147 recurrent laryngeal nerves were dissected. Intraoperative neural monitoring technology was applied and the &#x201c;four-step method&#x201d; used to monitor recurrent laryngeal nerve function. When the intraoperative signal was attenuated by more than 50&#x25;, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury was diagnosed, and the point and causes of injury were determined. The time required to identify the recurrent laryngeal nerve was 0.5&#x2013;2&#x2009;min and the injury rate was 2.7&#x25;; injuries were diagnosed intraoperatively. Injury most commonly occurred at or close to the point of entry of the nerve into the larynx and was caused by stretching, tumor adhesion, heat, and clamping. The groups are divided in chronological order; a learning curve for using intraoperative neural monitoring technology in thyroid cancer surgery was generated based on the time to identify the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the number of cases with nerve injury. The time to identify the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the number of injury cases decreased markedly with increasing patient numbers. There is a clear learning curve in applying intraoperative neural monitoring technology to thyroid cancer surgery; appropriate use of such technology aids in the protection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8904736/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:11:12.920Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:11:12.920Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552640ae9a4c4f652b3ce8","title":"Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Mediates Ebastine-Induced Human Follicle Dermal Papilla Cell Proliferation","abstract":"Ebastine is a second-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist that is used to attenuate allergic inflammation.

In this study, we examined the effects of ebastine on the growth of human follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPC) using a WST-1 cell proliferation assay and a bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay. Ebastine was shown to significantly increase the proliferation of HFDPC. The expression levels of cell-cycle regulatory proteins and an antiapoptotic protein were increased in ebastine-treated HFDPC. Furthermore, elevated expression levels of phospho-AKT and phospho-p44/42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were observed in ebastine-treated HFDPC. Ebastine-mediated HFDPC growth was completely reversed by blocking ERK kinase.

The purpose of this review is to provide updated knowledge on how the current evidence has bridged the gap between advancements in the evolution of diagnosis and treatment of esophageal achalasia. The advent of high-resolution manometry and standardization based on the Chicago classification has increased early recognition of the disease. These 3 clinical subtypes of achalasia can predict the outcomes of patients, and the introduction of POEM has revolutionized the choice of treatment. Previous evidence has shown that laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) and anterior fundoplication were considered the most durable treatments for achalasia. Based on the current evidence, POEM has been evolving as a promising strategy and is effective against all 3 types of achalasia, but the efficacy of POEM is based on short- and medium-term outcome studies from a limited number of centers. Types I and II achalasia respond well to POEM, LHM, and PD, while most studies have shown that type III achalasia responds better to POEM than to LHM and PD. In general, among the 3 subtypes of achalasia, type II achalasia has the most favorable outcomes after medical or surgical therapies. The long-term efficacy of POEM is still unknown. The novel ENDOFLIP measures the changes in intraoperative esophagogastric junction dispensability, which enables a quantitative assessment of luminal patency and sphincter distension; however, this technology is in its infancy with little data to date supporting its intraoperative use.

However, analysis of the toxic side effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed that rs4442975 was associated with bone marrow suppression, with an OR of 0.38 (95&#x25; confidence interval = 0.17&#x2013;0.73,<i> p</i> = 0.005) in the dominant model. In summary, the functional genetic variant rs4442975 was associated with bone marrow suppression during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for luminal A type breast cancer. These results may help establish reliable molecular markers for predicting the prognosis of personalized treatment for luminal A type breast cancer and thereby contribute to the development of appropriate therapies.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/7073498/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:11:30.428Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:11:30.428Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552652ae9a4c4f652b3cf7","title":"Prevalence, Antimicrobial Susceptibility Pattern of Bacterial Isolates, and Associated Factors of Urinary Tract Infections among HIV‐Positive Patients at Hiwot Fana Specialized University Hospital, Eastern Ethiopia","abstract":"Urinary tract infection remains a major public health problem in developing countries, where there are limited health-care services.

This paper presents data on the prevalence of MRSA and resistance pattern to other antibiotics on the selected specimen from two referral hospitals in Asmara, Eritrea. <i>Method</i>. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 130 participants recruited from two referral hospitals in Asmara, Eritrea. Isolation of <i>S. aureus</i> was based on culture and biochemical profiles. Standard antimicrobial disks representing multiple drug classes were subsequently set for oxacillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, and vancomycin.

They represent a class of endogenous noncoding single-strand small molecules. An abundance of miRNA clusters has been found in the genomes of various organisms often located in a polycistron. The miR-17-92 family is among the most famous miRNAs and has been identified as an oncogene. The functions of this cluster, together with the seven individual molecules that it comprises, are most related to cancers, so it would not be surprising that they are considered to have involvement in the development of tumors. The miR-17-92 cluster is therefore expected not only to be a tumor marker, but also to perform an important role in the early diagnosis of those diseases and possibly also be a target for tumor biotherapy. The miR-17-92 cluster affects the development of disease by regulating many related cellular processes and multiple target genes. Interestingly, it also has important roles that cannot be ignored in disease of the nervous system and circulation and modulates the growth and development of bone. Therefore, it provides new opportunities for disease prevention, clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy. Here we review the role of the miR-17-92 cluster that has received little attention in relation to neurological diseases, cardiac diseases, and the development of bone and tumors.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9450240/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:11:46.787Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:11:46.787Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552662ae9a4c4f652b3d02","title":"Association of Autoantibodies against M2-Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor with Atrial Fibrosis in Atrial Fibrillation Patients","abstract":"<i>Objectives</i>.

Banked human milk (BHM) offers potential health benefits to premature babies. BHM is pasteurized to mitigate infectious risks, but pasteurization is ineffective against sporulating bacteria such as <i>Bacillus cereus</i>. Sepsis related to <i>Bacillus cereus</i> in premature infants is severe and can often be fatal.

Our aim was to estimate the potential risk of <i>Bacillus cereus</i> infection in preterm infants caused by the ingestion of contaminated pasteurized BHM using different post-pasteurization release criteria (i.e., 9 sampling of 100 microliters versus the HMBANA guideline of 1 sampling of 100&#x2009;microliters per pool). <i>Methods</i>. In the absence of scientific evidence regarding the risk of <i>Bacillus cereus</i> infection by the ingestion of BHM in premature infants, risk assessment using Monte Carlo simulation with the exponential dose-response model was performed.

The present study reports a rapid synthesis method for the formation of iron nanoparticles and its potential efficacy as an antibacterial agent and an antioxidant. Because of its antibacterial property, ginger extract was used to coat surgical cotton. Synthesized ginger root iron nanoparticles (GR-FeNPs) were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction analysis, and particle size analysis. XRD confirmed the crystalline structure of iron oxide nanoparticles as it showed the crystal plane (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), and (4 0 0). The particle size analyzer (PSA) showed the average size of the particles, 56.2&#x2009;nm. The antimicrobial activity of the FeNPs was tested against different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. <i>E. coli</i> showed maximum inhibition as compared with the other organisms. Antioxidant activity proved the maximum rate of free radicals at 160&#x2009;<i>&#xb5;</i>g/mL produced by nanoparticles. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of nanocoated surgical cotton was evaluated on the first day and 30<sup>th</sup> day after coating, which clearly showed excellent growth inhibition of organisms, setting a new path in the field of medical microbiology. Hence, iron-nanocoated surgical cotton synthesized using green chemistry, which is antimicrobial and cost effective, might be economically helpful and provide insights to the medical field, replacing conventional wound healing treatments, for better prognosis.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aps/2019/9825969/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:00.555Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:00.555Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f552670ae9a4c4f652b3d0d","title":"Ilececum: A Comprehensive Review","abstract":"For gastrointestinal endoscopists, the ileocecum is the finishing line during colonoscopy and it is identified by three endoscopic landmarks: terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, and the appendiceal orifice.

Watson for Oncology (WFO) is a cognitive technology that processes medical information by analyzing the latest evidence and guidelines. However, studies of the concordance rate between WFO and clinicians for advanced gastric cancer (AGC) are lacking.<i> Methods</i>. We retrospectively reviewed 65 patients with AGC who consulted WFO and the Gachon Gil Medical Center multidisciplinary team (GMDT) in 2016 and 2017. The recommendations of WFO were compared with the opinions of the GMDT. WFO provided three treatment options: recommended (first treatment option), for consideration (second treatment option), and not recommended.<i> Results</i>. In total, 65 patients (mean age 61.0 years; 44 males and 21 females) were included in the study. The concordance rate between WFO and the GMDT was 41.5&#x25; (27/65) at the recommended level and 87.7&#x25; (57/65) at the for consideration level. The main causes of discordance between WFO and the GMDT were as follows. First, WFO did not consider the medical history. Second, WFO recommended the use of agents that are considered outdated in Korea. Third, some patients wanted to be involved in a clinical trial. Fourth, some patients refused to use the biologic agents recommended by WFO for financial reasons as they were not covered by medical insurance.<i> Conclusions</i>. The concordance rate at the recommended level was relatively low but was higher at the for consideration level. Discordances arose mainly from the different medical circumstances at the Gachon Gil Medical Center (GMC) and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), the main WFO consulting center.

Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is the most prevalent monogenic disease in Brazil. In SCA, haemoglobin S (HbS) is formed, which modifies red blood cell morphology. Intravascular haemolysis occurs, in which free Hb and free radicals degrade nitric oxide (NO) and release arginase, which reduces arginine levels. Because arginine is a substrate for NO formation, this decrease leads to reduced NO (vasodilator) synthesis. SCA treatment uses hydroxyurea (HU) to maintain high foetal haemoglobin (HbF) levels and reduces HbS to avoid haemolytic episodes.<i> Objective</i>. To analyse the efficacy of L-arginine as an adjuvant in the treatment of SCA patients.<i> Setting</i>. The State Blood Centre of Cear&#xe1;, Brazil.<i> Methods</i>. This was a randomized double-blind clinical study of adults with SCA with continuous use of HU at the State Blood Centre of Cear&#xe1;. The clinical study enrolled 25 patients receiving HU + L-arginine (500 mg) and 25 patients receiving HU + placebo. The treatment was carried out over four months. Laboratory tests were performed to determine the levels of the following: (1) complete blood count; (2) nitrite + nitrate; (3) HbF; and (4) reticulocytes. The clinical experiments were performed by a haematologist. The main outcome measures were nitrite and pain.<i> Results</i>. Statistical analysis showed that the levels of NO were increased in the study group, and there was also a reduction in pain frequency using a pain frequency scale by day, week, and month. The levels of nitrite plus nitrate in the group receiving placebo plus HU did not change among the times evaluated (38.27 &#xb1; 17.27 mg/L, 39.49 &#xb1; 12.84 mg/L, 34.45 &#xb1; 11.25 mg/L,<i> p</i> &#x3e;0.05), but in the patients who received supplementation with L-arginine plus HU, a significant increase in nitrite plus nitrate levels was observed between M0 and M4 (36.55 &#xb1; 20.23 mg/L versus 48.64 &#xb1; 20.63 mg/L,<i> p</i> =0.001) and M2 and M4 (35.71 &#xb1; 15.11 mg/L versus 48.64 &#xb1; 20.63 mg/L,<i> p</i> &#x3c;0.001). It is important to note that the increase in nitrite plus nitrate levels occurred only in the fourth month of follow-up of patients in the treatment group, showing that at least 4 months of supplementation with L-arginine is necessary to show an increase in these metabolites in the serum.<i> Conclusion</i>. The use of L-arginine as a coadjuvant in the treatment of sickle cell anaemia may function as a potential tool for pain relief, consequently improving the life of patients.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ah/2019/4397150/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:00.555Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:00.555Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55267fae9a4c4f652b3d10","title":"Ectoine-Containing Inhalation Solution versus Saline Inhalation Solution in the Treatment of Acute Bronchitis and Acute Respiratory Infections: A Prospective, Controlled, Observational Study","abstract":"<i>Purpose</i>.

In the past few decades, research has shown that NSAIDs may decrease the risk of certain types of cancer. However, there is also a growing body of research that proves the contrary. Furthermore, NSAIDs are well known for many side effects, including some life-threatening ones. This review will discuss the relationship between chronic inflammation and cancer, the role of NSAIDs in cancer prevention and cancer promotion, and some of the potentially lethal side effects of these drugs.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aps/2019/3418975/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:15.585Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:15.585Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55267fae9a4c4f652b3d13","title":"Combination of Fresh Frozen Plasma and Cryosupernatant Plasma for Therapeutic Plasma Exchange in Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: A Single Institution Experience","abstract":"<i>Purpose</i>. To evaluate the impact of a combination of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryosupernatant plasma (CP) as a replacement fluid in therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) on early therapeutic response and long-term survival of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).<i> Materials and Methods</i>. A total of 44 patients with suspected TTP were screened by Bentley and PLASMIC scores. Twenty-seven patients treated with TPE using the FFP and CP combination as the replacement fluid were enrolled and divided into two groups: 11 patients who received TPE with CP-dominant replacement fluid (FFP/CP&#x3c;1) and 16 patients who received TPE with FFP-dominant replacement fluid (FFP/CP&#x3e;1).<i> Results</i>. There were no significant differences in the demographic and clinicopathological characteristics between the two groups except for the international normalized ratio (INR). The number of TPE procedures was lower, and time to achieve complete response was shorter in the CP-dominant group than in the FFP-dominant group.

The CP-dominant replacement fluid was superior to the FFP-dominant replacement fluid in early response to TPE in patients with TTP, but did not impact the patients&#x2019; overall survival.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/1756109/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:15.585Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:15.585Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55267fae9a4c4f652b3d12","title":"Neuroprotective Effect of Echinacoside in Subacute Mouse Model of Parkinson’s Disease","abstract":"<i>Objective</i>. To study the protective effect of Echinacoside for 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced dopaminergic (DA) neurons injury in the subacute mouse model of Parkinson&#x2019;s disease (PD) and to explore its mechanism of action.<i> Methods</i>. We chose 10 weeks of healthy wild type C57BL/6 male mice, hypodermic MPTP 30 mg/kg/day, five days, to prepare PD subacute mouse model. Behavior indexes of open field test and pole test were applied to examine the function of ECH to PD subacute mice model of PD sample action. The effects of ECH on dopaminergic neurons and astrocyte were examined using Immunohistochemistry including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. The total numbers of TH-positive neurons and GFAP-positive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacts (SNpc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) were obtained stereologically using the optical fractionator method. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was used to detect the inflammatory cytokines in the serum, including TNF-<i>&#x3b1;</i> (Ttumor necrosis factor alpha) and IFN-<i>&#x3b3;</i> (interferon gamma). Protein expressions of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1), TNF-<i>&#x3b1;</i>, Cleaved caspase-3, glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and phosphorylated and total extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK and ERK) in the anatomical region of substantia nigra (SN) were tested by protein immunoblot method (i.e., Western blotting).<i> Results</i>. ECH reversed the reduction of total distance in open field test in MPTP-induced PD model mice (P &#x3c; 0.01), shortened the return time and total time of PD subacute model mice in pole test (P &#x3c; 0.01, P &#x3c; 0.05), significantly reversed the reduction of TH positive neurons induced by MPTP (P &#x3c; 0.05), and reduced the activation of astrocytes (P &#x3c; 0.05). Meanwhile, ECH significantly inhibited the expression of IBA-1, Cleaved caspase-3, and TNF-<i>&#x3b1;</i> in midbrain of MPTP model mice (P &#x3c; 0.05, P &#x3c; 0.05, and P &#x3c; 0.05) and upregulated the expression of GDNF (P &#x3c; 0.05). And ECH lowered the level of TNF-<i>&#x3b1;</i> and IFN-<i>&#x3b3;</i> in serum (P &#x3c; 0.05, P &#x3c; 0.05).<i> Conclusion</i>. ECH has protective effects on the MPTP subacute model mice, its mechanism may be through inhibiting activation of microglia and astrocytes, reducing inflammatory reaction and promoting the secretion of neurotrophic factors, and eventually resulting in the reduction of the DA neurons apoptosis.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4379639/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:15.585Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:15.585Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55267fae9a4c4f652b3d15","title":"Prediction of Apoptosis Protein Subcellular Localization with Multilayer Sparse Coding and Oversampling Approach","abstract":"The prediction of apoptosis protein subcellular localization plays an important role in understanding the progress in cell proliferation and death. Recently computational approaches to this issue have become very popular, since the traditional biological experiments are so costly and time-consuming that they cannot catch up with the growth rate of sequence data anymore. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of apoptosis protein subcellular localization, we proposed a sparse coding method combined with traditional feature extraction algorithm to complete the sparse representation of apoptosis protein sequences, using multilayer pooling based on different sizes of dictionaries to integrate the processed features, as well as oversampling approach to decrease the influences caused by unbalanced data sets. Then the extracted features were input to a support vector machine to predict the subcellular localization of the apoptosis protein. The experiment results obtained by Jackknife test on two benchmark data sets indicate that our method can significantly improve the accuracy of the apoptosis protein subcellular localization prediction.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/2436924/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:15.585Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:15.585Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55267fae9a4c4f652b3d14","title":"New Gene Markers of Angiogenesis and Blood Vessels Development in Porcine Ovarian Granulosa Cells during Short-Term Primary Culture In Vitro","abstract":"The physiological processes that drive the development of ovarian follicle, as well as the process of oogenesis, are quite well known.

The results showed that 6 mg/ml of HBV, 20 <i>μ</i>g/ml of cisplatin, and 6 mg/ml HBV with 10 <i>μ</i>g/ml cisplatin could induce approximately 50% of 4T1 cell death. The concentration 7 mg/ml of HBV with of 62.76% inhibitory rate showed the highest antimutagenic activity in comparison with other treatment groups. <i>Conclusions</i>. The MTT assay demonstrated that HBV and cisplatin could cause cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxic effect of cisplatin also promoted by HBV. Ames test outcomes indicated that HBV could act as a significant mutagenic agent. The antimutagenic activity of HBV was increased considerably in the presence of S9 mix.

Limited data are available from real-world practices in Europe describing prevailing treatment patterns and outcomes in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), particularly by cytogenetic risk.<i> Methods</i>. A retrospective medical record review was conducted in 200 RRMM patients in France. From first relapse, patients were assessed on second-/third-line treatments, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and healthcare utilization.<i> Results</i>. Fifty-five high risk and 113 standard risk patients were identified. Overall, 192 patients (96&#x25;) received second-line therapy after relapse.

A case of a 22-year-old female with left lower extremity pain, weakness, and numbness after prolonged stasis from a night of drug and alcohol use is presented. She also complained of left low back pain. Her initial neurologic examination was significant for decreased deep tendon reflexes, decreased motor strength, and decreased sensation in the left lower extremity. Severe pain in the affected region persisted despite several attempts at pain control utilizing multiple modalities. An emergent MRI of the lumbar spine revealed gluteal compartment syndrome. The patient ultimately underwent emergent fasciotomy with resultant improvement in neurologic symptoms. Because presenting symptoms are frequently nonspecific in initial stages, gluteal compartment syndrome is often misdiagnosed. This can lead to unnecessary morbidity and mortality.

However, current models suggest that emotional recognition is subserved by a distributed network cantered on the amygdala, which involves both cortical and subcortical structures. While the cortical system is preferentially tuned to process high spatial frequencies, the subcortical networks are more sensitive to low-spatial frequencies. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether emotion perception from low-spatial frequencies underpinning the subcortical system is relatively preserved in TBI patients. We tested a group of 14 subjects with severe TBI and 20 matched healthy controls. Each participant was asked to recognize the emotion expressed by each stimulus that consisted of happy and fearful faces, filtered for their low and high spatial frequencies components. Results in TBI patients&#x2019; performances showed that low-spatial frequency expressions were recognized with higher accuracy and faster reaction times when compared to high spatial frequency stimuli. On the contrary, healthy controls did not show any effect in the two conditions, neither for response accuracy nor for reaction times.

Continuous data growth and diversity in data characteristics comprise what is called big data; current biological SSMs cannot handle big data. Therefore, these measures need the ability to control the size of big data. We used parallel and distributed processing by splitting data into multiple partitions and applied SSM measures to each partition; this approach helped manage big data scalability and computational problems. Our solution involves three steps: split gene ontology (GO), data clustering, and semantic similarity calculation. To test this method, split GO and data clustering algorithms were defined and assessed for performance in the first two steps. Three of the best SSMs in biology [Resnik, Shortest Semantic Differentiation Distance (SSDD), and SORA] are enhanced by introducing threaded parallel processing, which is used in the third step. Our results demonstrate that introducing threads in SSMs reduced the time of calculating semantic similarity between gene pairs and improved performance of the three SSMs. Average time was reduced by 24.51&#x25; for Resnik, 22.93&#x25;, for SSDD, and 33.68&#x25; for SORA.

Radiotherapy is the mainstay in the treatment of prostate cancer. However, significant radioresistance of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells constitutes a main obstacle in the treatment of this disease. By using bioinformatic data mining methods, LOXL2 was found to be upregulated in both androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines and radioresistant tumor samples collected from patients with prostate cancer. We speculate that LOXL2 may play an important role in the radioresistance of CRPC cells.<i> Methods</i>. The effect of LOXL2 knockdown on the radiosensitivity of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells lines was measured by the clonogenic assay and xenograft tumor experiments under in vitro and in vivo conditions, respectively. In studies on the mechanism, we focused on the EMT phenotype changes and cell apoptosis changes induced by LOXL2 knockdown in DU145 cells. The protein levels of three EMT biomarkers, namely, E-cadherin, vimentin, and N-cadherin, were measured by western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. Cell apoptosis after irradiation was measured by flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity assay. Salvage experiment was also conducted to confirm the possible role of EMT in the radiosensitization effect of LOXL2 knockdown in CRPC cells.<i> Results</i>. LOXL2 knockdown in CRPC cells enhanced cellular radiosensitivity under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. A significant reversal of EMT was observed in LOXL2-silenced DU145 cells. Cell apoptosis after irradiation was significantly enhanced by LOXL2 knockdown in DU145 cells. Results from the salvage experiment confirmed the key role of EMT process reversal in the radiosensitization effect of LOXL2 knockdown in DU145 cells.<i> Conclusions</i>. LOXL2 plays an important role in the development of cellular radioresistance in CRPC cells. Targeting LOXL2 may be a rational avenue to overcome radioresistance in CRPC cells. A LOXL2-targeting strategy for CRPC treatment warrants detailed investigation in the future.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4012590/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:47.854Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:47.854Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55269fae9a4c4f652b3d25","title":"Proinflammatory Role of Angiotensin II in the Aorta of Normotensive Mice","abstract":"Angiotensin II plays important functions in cardiovascular system mediating actions leading to inflammatory responses such as activation of VSMC in order to produce ROS, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Changes in angiotensin II production could stimulate the recruitment and activation of myeloid cells initiating local inflammatory response without effect on BP. We aimed to verify if angiotensin II induces an inflammatory response in the aorta and if it correlates with variations in BP. C57Bl/6 mice treated with saline solution (0.9&#x25;, control group) or angiotensin II (30ng/kg, Ang II group) were used. BP and HR levels were measured. Immunohistochemistry for IL1-<i>&#x3b2;</i>, TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i>, iNOS, CD45, and <i>&#x3b1;</i>-actin was performed in the aorta. BP and HR do not change. A biphasic response was observed both for IL1-<i>&#x3b2;</i> and TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i> expression and also for the presence of CD45 positive cells, with an acute increase (between 30 and 60 minutes) and a second increase, between 24 and 48 hours. Positive staining for iNOS increased in the earlier period (30 minutes) in perivascular adipose tissue and in a longer period (48 hours) in tunica adventitia. Immunoblotting to <i>&#x3b1;</i>-actin showed no alterations, suggesting that the applied dose of angiotensin II does not alter the aortic VSMCs phenotype. The results suggest that angiotensin II, even at doses that do not alter BP, induces the expression of inflammatory markers and migration of inflammatory cells into the aorta of normotensive mice. Thus, angiotensin II may increase the propensity to develop a cardiovascular injury, even in normotensive individuals.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/9326896/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:47.854Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:47.854Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55269fae9a4c4f652b3d26","title":"Bioinformatics Analysis Reveals the Altered Gene Expression of Patients with Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Using Liuweidihuang Pills Treatment","abstract":"Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP), as well as its associated increased risk for fragility fracture, is one of the most disabling consequences of aging in women. This present study aimed to identify candidate genes that involve pathogenesis of PMOP and the therapeutic mechanism of Liuweidihuang (LWDH) pills on PMOP. We integrated microarray datasets of PMOP derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PMOP and normal controls as well as patients with PMOP and patients after treatment of LWDH pills. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis for DEGs were performed. The shared DEGs, associated with both the pathogenesis of PMOP and the therapeutic mechanism of LWDH, were further analyzed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to verify the DEGs obtained by our integrated analysis. Compared with normal controls, 1732 DEGs in PMOP were obtained with<i> p</i>&#x3c;0.05. According to the qRT-PCR results, expression of ATF2, FBXW7, RDX, and RBBP4 was consistent with that in our integrated analysis, generally. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that those DEGs were significantly enriched in regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent, cytoplasm, protein binding, and MAPK signaling pathway. A total of 58 shared DEGs in PMOP versus normal control and in patients with PMOP versus patients after LWDH treatment were identified, which had opposite expression trend in these two comparisons. In the PPI network, CSNK2A1, ATF2, and FBXW7 were three hub proteins. Three genes including ATF2, FBXW7, and RDX were speculated to be therapeutic targets of LWDH for PMOP based on BATMAN-TCM database. We speculated that three genes of ATF2, FBXW7, and RDX may play crucial roles in both pathogenesis of PMOP and therapeutic mechanism of LWDH on PMOP. Our results may provide clues for the molecular pathogenesis of PMOP and offer new possibilities for treatment of PMOP.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/1907906/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:47.854Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:47.854Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55269fae9a4c4f652b3d27","title":"The Difficult Airway Trolley: A Narrative Review and Practical Guide","abstract":"Death and severe morbidity attributable to anesthesia are commonly associated with failed difficult airway management. When an airway emergency develops, immediate access to difficult airway equipment is critical for implementation of rescue strategies. Previously, national expert consensus guidelines have provided only limited guidance for the design and setup of a difficult airway trolley. The overarching aim of the current work was to create a dedicated difficult airway trolley (for patients&#x3e;12 years old) for use in anesthesia theatres, intensive care units, and emergency departments. A systematic literature search was performed, using the PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar search engines. Based on evidence presented in 11 national or international guidelines, and peer-reviewed journals, we present and outline a difficult airway trolley organized to accommodate sequential progression through a four-step difficult airway algorithm. The contents of the top four drawers correspond to specific steps in the airway algorithm (A&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;intubation, B&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;oxygenation via a supraglottic airway device, C&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;facemask ventilation, and D&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;emergency invasive airway access). Additionally, specialized airway equipment may be included in the fifth drawer of the proposed difficult airway trolley, thus enabling widespread use. A logically designed, guideline-based difficult airway trolley is a vital resource for any clinician involved in airway management and may aid the adherence to difficult airway algorithms during evolving airway emergencies. Future research examining the availability of rescue airway devices in various clinical settings, and simulation studies comparing different types of difficult airway trolleys, are encouraged.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/arp/2019/6780254/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:47.854Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:47.854Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55269fae9a4c4f652b3d28","title":"Rothia dentocariosa Endocarditis in an Unsuspecting Host: A Case Report and Literature Review","abstract":"<i>Rothia dentocariosa</i>, a gram-positive coccobacillus, is a commensal bacterium that is part of the oropharynx and respiratory tract.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) supports cells and maintains the integrity of tooth germs during tooth development. However, details on the role of the ECM in tooth development are poorly understood. Here, we performed long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles in the ECM components of deciduous tooth germs by RNA sequencing in miniature pigs. From the early cap to the late bell stages, we identified 4,562 and 3,238 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from E40 to E50 and E50 to E60, respectively. In addition, a total of 1,464 differentially expressed lncRNAs from E40 to E50 and 969 differentially expressed lncRNAs from E50 to E60 were obtained. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that DEGs were enriched significantly for multiple signaling pathways, especially for the ECM pathway. We then outlined the detailed dynamic gene expression profiling of ECM components during deciduous molar development. Comparison of the cap and bell stages revealed that the structure and functions of the ECM dynamically changed. The ECM-related genes, including<i> THBS1, COL4A5, COL4A6, COL1A1, CHAD, TNR, GP1BA</i>, and<i> ITGA3</i>, were significantly changed, and some were shown to enrich during the bell stage development. Finally, we outlined the coexpression of lncRNAs and ECM properties during tooth development. We showed that the interplay of key lncRNAs could change ECM processes and influence the ECM establishment of tooth patterns to accomplish full tooth formation. These results might provide information to elucidate the regulation network of the lncRNA and ECM in tooth development.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/6159490/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:47.854Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:47.854Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f55269fae9a4c4f652b3d2b","title":"Selectivity of Dietary Phenolics for Inhibition of Human Monoamine Oxidases A and B","abstract":"Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) regulate local levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin and thus have been targeted by drugs for the treatment of certain CNS disorders.

Thus, targeting these enzymes may be a potential anti-aging strategy. The purpose of this study was to compare the MAO inhibition and selectivity of selected dietary phenolic compounds, using a previously validated assay that would avoid interference from the compounds. Kynuramine metabolism by human recombinant MAO-A and MAO-B leads to formation of 4-hydroxyquinoline, with Vmax values of 10.2&#xb1;0.2 and 7.35&#xb1;0.69 nmol/mg/min, respectively, and Km values of 23.1&#xb1;0.8 <i>&#x3bc;</i>M and 18.0&#xb1;2.3 <i>&#x3bc;</i>M, respectively.

Each of these significantly inhibited both enzymes except for zingerone, which only inhibited MAO-A. The IC50 values were determined, and selectivity indices (MAO-A/MAO-B IC<sub>50</sub> ratios) were calculated.

Fractures were evaluated according to AO, Frykman, and Fernandez classifications. Mortality ratios and long-term survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier estimator and log-rank tests with univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model were used.<i> Results</i>. We enrolled 1308 consecutive patients. The average age of the entire cohort was 72.5 ± 12 years. The study group consisted of 256 men (19.6%) with mean age 66 ± 12 y/o and 1052 women (80.4%) with mean age 74 ± 12 y/o. Men were statistically younger at the time of the fracture than women (p&lt;0.0001). After 1-year follow-up the overall study group mortality ratio was 4.5%, being 2.2-fold higher in men compared to women. In long-term survival analysis, excess men mortality remained significant. Factors associated with higher mortality at any point of the study were age (HR: 1.08, 95%CI: 1.07-1.10, p&lt;0.000001), male sex (HR: 1.92, 95%CI: 1.34-2.77; p&lt;0.001), AO type A (HR: 1.64 95%CI 1.19-2.25, p&lt;0.01), and Frykman type I (HR: 2.12 95%CI: 1.36-3.29, p&lt;0.001).<i> Conclusion</i>. Distal radius fractures are connected with premature mortality. Men have higher mortality compared with women following distal radius fracture in population aged 50 years or above. Simple extra articular fractures classified as AO type A or Frykman type I may be predictors of higher mortality in DRF cohort.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/5359204/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:47.854Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:12:47.854Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5526afae9a4c4f652b3d2d","title":"Effects of Exercise and Enzyme Therapy in Early Occupational Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: A Preliminary Study","abstract":"<i>Objectives.</i> Occupational carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) due to upper extremity overuse has in recent years been the most commonly recognized occupational disease in the Czech Republic and its prevalence has steadily increased. This pilot observation aimed to assess the effects of exercise techniques and oral enzyme therapy in automotive plant workers with early CTS.<i> Patients and Methods.</i> The observation comprised automotive plant assembly line workers in whom nerve conduction study revealed incipient CTS. The subjects were divided into three groups: a group practicing exercise techniques (exercising; N=15), a group receiving oral enzyme therapy (N=16), and a group of controls (N=14). Subjects in the control group were only observed without any specific intervention, which is a common procedure in incipient CTS. Throughout 9-week observation, the workers did their jobs. Prior to and after that period, the workers&#x2019; CTS-related symptoms were ascertained through structured interviews with a physician and the following median nerve parameters were measured: sensory conduction velocity (SCV) and distal motor latency (DML).<i> Results.</i> In both the exercise and enzyme therapy groups, statistically significant decreases in the total score for symptoms were achieved (p&#x3c;0.0001), unlike controls. On final examination, both treated groups demonstrated significantly increased SCV as compared with the initial values (p=0.00013 and p&#x3c;0.0001, respectively); in controls, the mean SCV did not significantly change. Similarly, a statistically significant shortening of DML was noted in the enzyme therapy group (p=0.008).<i> Conclusion.</i> The results showed the efficiency of both exercise and oral enzyme therapy in incipient CTS.

A key to<i> S. aureus </i>infections and its pathogenicity is its ability to survive in adverse environments, especially at lower temperatures, by regulation of its cell membrane. Branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) and staphyloxanthin have been shown to regulate membrane fluidity and staphylococcal virulence.

In addition to Lactobacilli, other microorganisms populate the cervicovaginal microbiota, like <i>Candida</i> spp. and <i>Gardnerella vaginalis</i>. The overgrowth of <i>Candida</i> spp. or <i>G. vaginalis</i>, known as biofilm-producing microorganisms in the genital ecosystem, may lead to microbial dysbiosis that increases the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, like <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>. <i>C. trachomatis</i>, the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases, is still considered an important public health problem worldwide because of the impact of asymptomatic infections on long-term reproductive sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. The aim of our study was to investigate the interaction between <i>C. trachomatis</i> and the biofilm produced by <i>Candida albicans</i> or <i>Gardnerella vaginalis</i>, evaluating whether the biofilm can harbor <i>C. trachomatis</i> and influence its survival as well as its infectious properties. In order to do so, we developed an <i>in vitro</i> coculture transwell-based biofilm model.

A total of 1,016 patients (63.8&#x25; males, mean age = 35.4) participated in a cross-sectional study using a culturally tailored HIV stigma measure in three HIV-epidemic-concentrated cities in Vietnam. Zero-inflated Poisson models were used to examine factors associated with the number of types of stigma that patients experienced. 86.2&#x25; PLWH reported experiencing stigma against HIV/AIDS, more frequently from their community (62.8&#x25;) and family (30.2&#x25;) than from health care facilities (8&#x25;). The level of stigma from community reported by PLWH is associated with socioeconomic status (e.g., income, occupation). The poor and middle economic classes and unemployed patients reported more stigmatization and discrimination from the community. Across all settings, PLWH experienced fewer stigmatization over the course of ART indicating the benefits of rapidly expanded ART programs. PLWH reported more stigmatization and discrimination at the provincial level of the health administration. Those with the history of drug injection reported significantly less stigmatization from healthcare setting. More culturally tailored interventions to reduce stigmatization overall to improve the quality of life and health outcomes of PLWH should be warranted to achieve the 90-90-90 goal. Improving HIV-related knowledge of the general population and providing opportunities for PLWH to be reintegrated into should be considered.

Curcumin has revealed its strong activities of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer. The efficient amount of curcumin could induce differentiation of stem cells and promoted the differentiation of glioma-initiating cells; however, the mechanisms underlying neural induction of curcumin have not yet been revealed. In this study, neural-inducing ability of curcumin was explored by using human pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells, NTERA2 cells. The cells were induced toward neural lineage with curcumin and were compared with a standard neutralizing agent (retinoic acid). It was found that, after 14 days of the induction by curcumin, NTERA2 cells showed neuronal morphology and expressed neural-specific genes, including<i> NeuroD</i>,<i> TUJ1</i>, and<i> PAX6</i>. Importantly, curcumin activated neurogenesis of NTERA2 cells via the activation of autophagy, since autophagy-related genes, such as<i> LC3</i>,<i> LAMP1</i>, and<i> ATG5</i>, were upregulated along with the expression of neural genes. The inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine suppressed both autophagy and neural differentiation, highlighting the positive role of autophagy during neural differentiation. This autophagy-mediated neural differentiation of curcumin was found to be an ROS-dependent manner; curcumin induced ROS generation and suppressed antioxidant gene expression. Altogether, this study proposed the neural-inducing activity of curcumin via the regulation of autophagy within NTERA2 cells and underscored the health beneficial effects of curcumin for neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and Parkinson&#x2019;s disease.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/4378710/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:13:19.870Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:13:19.870Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5526bfae9a4c4f652b3d3b","title":"Prognostic Factors of Mortality among Adult Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy in India: A Hospital Based Retrospective Cohort Study","abstract":"<i>Introduction</i>. HIV related deaths still continue to occur in large numbers in spite of good quality drugs being freely available in India. This study was therefore done to assess the prognostic factors of mortality among people living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART). This would help in planning strategies for further improving their survival.<i> Materials and Methods</i>. Record based data from baseline and follow-up visits of a cohort of patients aged above 14 years on ART was retrospectively reviewed over a seven-year period. The Kaplan-Meier models were used to estimate life time survival probability, and Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to determine independent prognostic factors of death, among patients, after initiation of ART.<i> Results</i>. Mean age of the total 285 patients enrolled in this study was 45.8&#xb1;9.7 years. Mean duration of treatment on ART was 1127&#xb1;611.8 days.

Nearly 80&#x25; of advanced prostate cancer patients respond to initial androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, ADT does not prevent the progression of prostate cancer over the long term, and the disease eventually progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Prior to the development of enzalutamide (ENZ) and abiraterone acetate, docetaxel was the only established treatment with life-prolongation for CRPC. ENZ is a second-generation anti-androgen receptor drug that has contributed to improving the prognosis of CRPC. Several studies have reported factors predicting the efficacy of ENZ; however, there are no confirmed biomarkers. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an easily calculated biomarker that is associated with the prognosis of several solid malignancies. However, there were few studies investigated NLR for ENZ in patients with mCRPC. We examined the usefulness of the NLR as a predictive tool for ENZ.<i> Methods</i>. We retrospectively examined a total of 106 CRPC patients who were treated with ENZ until September 2016 in Yokohama City University Hospital, Yokohama City University Medical Center, and National Cancer Center Hospital East. ENZ was routinely started as a dose of 160 mg per day; the dosage was reduced in some patients due to side effects. Drug holiday for 1-2 weeks or dose reduction to 80-120mg was done and no patients discontinued ENZ treatment due to adverse effects. ENZ was stopped when cancer progression was detected based on PSA elevation, radiographic findings, and deterioration of the patient&#x2019;s performance status. The cut-off NLRs for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were determined based on the receiver-operator curves. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyze the factors associated with OS or CSS and a log-rank test was performed. A multivariate analysis was also performed to analyze the factors associated with the prognosis.<i> Results</i>. We retrospectively reviewed 106 consecutive CRPC patients who were both treated with ENZ and were able to be counted before ENZ NLR. Cut-off point was 2.14 for both OS and CSS by receiver operator characteristic curve. The patients were then divided into the higher NLR group (&#x2265;2.14) and lower NLR group (&#x3c;2.14). Multivariate analysis showed that NLR and predocetaxel chemotherapy were independent risk factors for both overall and cancer-specific survival.<i> Conclusions</i>.

The area under curve value of BMPER for urosepsis was 0.829 (95&#x25; confidence interval [CI], 0.773 to 0.884). Uroseptic patients with higher BMPER concentration exhibited more adverse outcome. BMPER possesses valuable discriminative capacity for urosepsis and is a strong predictor of adverse outcome in patients with urosepsis.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/8078139/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:13:19.870Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:13:19.870Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5526cdae9a4c4f652b3d41","title":"An Approach to Enhance Dissolution Rate of Tamoxifen Citrate","abstract":"We tested the solubility and dissolution of tamoxifen citrate to ascertain the optimal conditions for faster dissolution. Using the solvent evaporation method and hydrophilic carriers, we formulated tamoxifen citrate (TC) that contained solid dispersions (SDs). We increased the solubility and dissolution rate of TC with a solid dispersion system that consisted of polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000), beta-cyclodextrin (<i>β</i>-CD), and a combination of carriers. Physicochemical characteristics of solubility (mg/ml) were found to be 0.987±0.04 (water), 1.324±0.05 (6.8pH PBS), and 1.156±0.03 (7.4 pH PBS) for F5 formulation, percentage yield was between 98.74 ± 1.11% and 99.06 ± 0.58%, drug content was between 98.06±0.58 and 99.06±1.10, and dissolution studies binary complex showed a faster release of TC as compared to a single polymer and pure drug. Furthermore, thermal properties, physicochemical drug and polymer interaction, crystal properties, and morphology were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray differential studies, and scanning electron microscopy. We used the same proportion of carrier concentrations of the formulations to calculate the solubility of TC. Our results demonstrated that increased concentrations of <i>β</i>-C yielded an improved solubility of TC, which was two times higher than pure TC. The uniformity in drug content was 97.99 %. A quicker drug release occurred from the binary complex formulation as seen in the dissolution profile. FTIR demonstrated an absence in the physicochemical interaction between the drug and carriers. The drug was also found to be dispersed in the amorphous state as revealed by DSC and XRD. The drug concentration did not vary during various storage conditions.

A retrospective review of both waitlist patients and LT recipients at a single institution was performed.

A total of 301 peptides were differentially expressed between MDR-TB and DS-TB groups. Of these, 24 and 16 peptides exhibited presented high (fold change &#x2265; 2.0, P &#x3c; 0.05) and low (fold change &#x2264; &#x2212;2.0, P &#x3c; 0.05) levels in MDR-TB. Significant canonical pathways included the prothrombin activation system, coagulation system, and complement system. In the network of differentially expressed precursor proteins, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) regulates many precursor proteins, including four proteins correlated with organism survival. These four important differentially expressed proteins are prothrombin (F2), complement receptor type 2 (CR2), collagen alpha-2(V) chain (COL5A2), and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITIH4).

The functions of differentially expressed peptides, especially CR2, in MDR-TB require further investigation.","year":"2019","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/5653424/","createdAt":"2020-09-06T18:13:33.033Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T18:13:33.033Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f723752e555c9747593cab6","title":"Susceptibility of Mature Staphylococcus Biofilms to Chinese Herbal Decoction Sanhuang Jiedu: An In Vitro Study","abstract":"<i>Background</i>. External socking and washing with the Chinese herbal Sanhuang Jiedu decoction (SHJD) can effectively control local limb infections with bone and implant exposure. However, the antibiofilm activities of this decoction <i>in vitro</i> have not yet been investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effects and characteristics of SHJD on the mature biofilms of multidrug-resistant <i>staphylococci</i> on a titanium surface. <i>Methods</i>. Biofilm-forming methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC</i> 35984 and <i>S. aureus ATCC</i> 43330, and non-biofilm-forming <i>S. epidermidis ATCC</i> 12228 were selected as the experimental strains. The mature biofilms were prepared on titanium surfaces. The five experimental groups were based on dilution concentrations (DC) of SHJD: the control group (biofilm incubated with 0.85% NaCl solution), the SHJD (DC:1/8) group (initial SHJD solution was diluted 1/8), the SHJD (DC:1/4) group, the SHJD (DC:1/2) group, and the SHJD (DC:1/1) group (initial SHJD solution). The effects of SHJD on the mature biofilms were observed with the bacterial spread plate method, crystal violet (CV) staining, scanning electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. <i>Results</i>. After culture in tryptic soy broth for 72 h, <i>ATCC</i> 43300 and <i>ATCC</i> 35984 produced mature biofilms and <i>ATCC</i> 12228 did not.

Recent advances in epigenetic research show that dysregulated miRNAs may participate in the development of orthopedic diseases and AIS. The aim of this study was to detect differentially expressed miRNAs in severe AIS and elucidate the mechanism of miRNA deregulation in the pathogenesis of AIS. In the present study, miRNA expression profiles were detected in severe and mild AIS patients as well as healthy controls by miRNA sequencing. Candidate miRNAs were validated in a larger cohort. Primary osteoblasts from severe AIS patients were extracted and isolated to determine the effect of the candidate miRNAs on bone metabolism. Finally, we determined the methylation level in primary osteoblasts from severe AIS patients. The result showed that miR-151a-3p was overexpressed in severe AIS patients. Reduced GREM1 expression was observed in primary osteoblasts from severe AIS patients. miR-151a-3p directly inhibited GREM1 in primary osteoblasts. Relatively lower methylation levels were detected in primary osteoblasts from severe AIS patients. In conclusion, our study revealed that plasma miR-151a-3p levels may serve as a biomarker for severe AIS. Overexpression of miR-151a-3p may interrupt bone homeostasis via inhibiting GREM1 expression. Our result may provide a new biomarker for the early detection of AIS and increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of AIS.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/4243015/","createdAt":"2020-09-28T19:19:46.630Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T19:19:46.630Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f723752e555c9747593cabb","title":"Combinational Use of Antiplatelet Medication Sarpogrelate with Therapeutic Drug Rosuvastatin in Treating High-Cholesterol Diet-Induced Chronic Kidney Disease in ApoE-Deficient Mice","abstract":"A number of metabolic disorders, including hyperlipidemia, potentially cause chronic kidney disease (CKD), one of their major chronic complications and comorbidities. Rosuvastatin is one of the widely used antiatherogenic drugs among hyperlipidemic patients. Meanwhile, sarpogrelate is not only a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist but also an antiplatelet agent, inhibiting platelet-stimulated blood coagulation and improving peripheral circulation. In this study, a combination of sarpogrelate and/or rosuvastatin was used on CKD mice induced by a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. The mice were tested for pathological changes using histological evaluation. Tremendous alterations were found, including a remarked increase in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, glomerular endothelial proliferation, and mesangial expansion. Also, tubular damage and extracellular matrix accumulation occurred, namely, a marked increase in the macula densa, scattered and apoptotic loss of the apical brush border with vacuolated basophilic cytoplasm and heavily stained nuclei, and expanded Bowman&#x2019;s space, which were at least partially ameliorated by sarpogrelate and/or rosuvastatin treatment. The analysis of expression profiles at both the RNA and protein levels, using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, indicated that LDL-R/CD68/LOX-1-positive monocyte/macrophage-mediated enhanced proinflammatory activation, including the significant upregulation of tumor necrosis factor-<i>&#x03B1;</i> and interleukin-6, was actually attenuated by sarpogrelate and/or rosuvastatin treatment.

Eight weeks later, all rats were killed and their tissues were subjected to radiographic and histological analyses. <i>Results</i>. According to the results, alendronate administration improved the trabecular thickness and separation in micro-CT analysis but had no significant evidence in increasing the bone area and decreasing the ratio of osteocyte lacunae in histological analysis when compared with the control group. Meanwhile, the alendronate group had more OCs, but less OCN and VEGF levels along with decreased p-AKT, HIF-1<i>α</i>, RANKL, and NFATc1 expressions than the control group. For comparison, alendronate combined with DFO further improved the bone volume, trabecular number, trabecular separation, and trabecular thickness with lower ratio of osteocyte lacunae and OC number, higher expression of OCN and VEGF and upregulated signal factors of HIF-1<i>α</i> and <i>β</i>-catenin, and decreased RANKL and NFATc1. <i>Conclusion</i>. Combined pharmacotherapy with alendronate and desferoxamine provide significant effects in regulating the bone resorption and bone regeneration for preventing GIOFN.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/3120458/","createdAt":"2020-09-28T19:20:25.764Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T19:20:25.764Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f723779e555c9747593cb38","title":"A Randomized Controlled Trial: Comparison of 4% Articaine versus 0.5% Bupivacaine for Ambulatory Orthopedic Surgery under Supraclavicular Block","abstract":"<i>Background</i>. Articaine has been used in many dental and ophthalmic outpatient procedures. In the era of ultrasound-guided regional techniques, we searched for short and potent local anesthetic for patients undergoing ambulatory upper limb procedures. However, studies about articaine efficacy in brachial plexus block are limited. In this study, we compared its safety and efficacy against bupivacaine as a commonly used anesthetic agent for ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block. <i>Methods</i>. This randomized prospective study was performed at Ain Shams University Hospital from January to March 2020. A total of 117 patients aged 20 to 60 years, with the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II, were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups: in group A, patients received 30&#x2009;ml articaine 2&#x0025;, and in group B, patients received 30&#x2009;ml of bupivacaine 0.5&#x0025;. We measured motor and sensory block duration as a primary outcome. Other secondary outcomes such as onset of block, duration of analgesia, patient satisfaction, and time to home discharge readiness were also measured. <i>Results</i>. We analyzed data collected from 97 patients. The motor block duration was significantly shorter in group A (165.73&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;20.33&#x2009;min) than in group B (220.27&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;37.73&#x2009;min). The onset of motor block was faster in group A (8.73&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.33&#x2009;min), and the postoperative VAS score was lower in group B. Patients in group A achieved an earlier home discharge of 289.67&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.73&#x2009;min. <i>Conclusion</i>. Earlier resolution of articaine block makes it more favorable than bupivacaine for ambulatory surgery.

However, its specific role in other cancers is still poorly understood. This study is aimed at investigating the role of USP46 in lung cancer tumorigenesis and identifying its underlying mechanisms. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB) were used to measure the expression levels of USP46 and PHLPP1 in lung cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue from patients with lung cancer. We examined the ability of USP46 to regulate cell proliferation in lung cancer cells via cell proliferation assay, radiation assay, genetic overexpression and knockdown, and chemical inhibition of relevant genes. We investigated the underlying mechanisms in multiple lung cancer cell line models by coimmunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays. In this study, we identified a strong downregulation of the expressions of USP46 and PHLPP1 in lung cancer tissues relative to normal adjacent tissues. USP46 was further shown to inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation under conditions of normal growth and during radiation-induced DNA damage by antagonizing the ubiquitination of PHLPP1 resulting in the inhibition of AKT signaling. Exposure to radiation and AKT inhibition significantly reversed the effect of USP46 siRNA on lung cancer cell proliferation. USP46 is downregulated in lung cancer and suppresses the proliferation of lung cancer cells by inhibiting the PHLPP1/AKT pathway. AKT inhibition slows the proliferation of lung cancer cells that have been downregulated by USP46 and exposed to radiation. This suggests a potential therapeutic avenue for USP46-downregulated lung cancer through a combination of radiation and AKT inhibitor treatment.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/2509529/","createdAt":"2020-09-28T19:20:25.764Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T19:20:25.764Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f723779e555c9747593cb3a","title":"The Correlation between PSCA Expression and Neuroendocrine Differentiation in Prostate Cancer","abstract":"The prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), as a predominantly prostate-specific marker, is overexpressed in most prostate cancer specimens, is positively correlated with prostate cancer androgen independence, and has the potential to be treated with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as a gene therapy target. Using the typical androgen deprivation therapy, most tumors will progress to CRPC, as well as develop into neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) characterized by the expression of neuroendocrine markers such as enolase 2 (NSE). Our study was aimed at investigating the expressions of PSCA and NSE and the relationship between the two markers, as well as the correlation between the PSCA and NSE expressions and the clinicopathological parameters in prostate cancer specimens from 118 patients by using immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrated that the PSCA and NSE protein expressions did not correlate with the prostate cancer patients&#x2019; age or the hormone therapy but showed a significant correlation with the pathological tumor stage of prostate cancer, the Gleason score, and the presence of metastasis. There is a positive association between PSCA and NSE but a negative one between the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSCA or between PSA and NSE. High PSCA and NSE expressions correlated with a poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients.

Since it is a novel virus, there are basically no proven drugs or therapies; although many laboratories in different countries are working to develop a vaccine, it will take time to make it available. Passive immunization is the therapy born from the intuition of Behring and Kisato in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. It was widely used for the treatment of bacterial infections until the discovery of antibiotics, as well as during the viral pandemics of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and of the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup>; it still has clinical applications (e.g., tetanus prevention). This paper summarizes the basic principles of passive immunization, with particular reference to convalescent plasma. The literature concerning its use during past epidemics and the results of the first clinical studies concerning its use during the current pandemic are discussed too. A large section is dedicated to the analysis of the possible, although rare, side effects. Recently, in 2017, the WHO Blood Regulators Network (BRN) published a position paper, recommending convalescent plasma as the first-choice treatment to be tested in the absence of authorized drugs; however, this strategy has not been followed. In the current epidemic, the principle of passive immunization through convalescent plasma has been applied in several circumstances and particularly in patients with serious complications. The first reported results are encouraging and confirm the effectiveness of plasma therapy and its safety. Also, the FDA has proposed plasma treatment in order to face the increasingly complex situation and manage patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 disease. Several studies and clinical programs are still ongoing.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/2606058/","createdAt":"2020-09-28T19:21:44.601Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T19:21:44.601Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f723807e555c9747593cc9c","title":"Computational Evaluation of the Inhibition Efficacies of HIV Antivirals on SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Protease and Identification of 3D Pharmacophore and Hit Compounds","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus behind the fast-spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Pharmaceutical researchers are currently researching medications or preventive vaccines that may be used to treat and combat the spread of COVID-19. Health practitioners all over the world are treating patients with currently available antiviral drugs, primarily the protease inhibitors used for HIV treatment. The present study mainly aims to evaluate the potencies of eight anti-HIV drugs to inhibit coronavirus protease using <i>in silico</i> methods. Derivation of pharmacophore, identification of hit molecules, and checking their virtual inhibition efficacies on the COVID-19 protease were also carried out in the present investigation. Classification of eight drug molecules (atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir (amprenavir&#x2014;metabolised product), saquinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, and indinavir) based on their molecular structures was completed and reported. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the main protease of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 protease) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank and prepared for computational studies using Edu PyMOL software. Docking studies were performed with AutoDock Vina software, and the results were evaluated with Discovery Studio software. The binding scores of the drugs on protease followed the order saquinavir&#x2009;&#x3e;&#x2009;nelfinavir&#x2009;&#x3e;&#x2009;lopinavir&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;indinavir&#x2009;&#x3e;&#x2009;darunavir&#x2009;&#x3e;&#x2009;amprenavir&#x2009;&#x3e;&#x2009;ritonavir&#x2009;&#x3e;&#x2009;atazanavir. Web servers such as PharmaGist and ZINCPharmer were employed to derive the 3D pharmacophore and to identify potential hit compounds, respectively. The identified hit molecules were docked with the SARS-CoV-2 protease and analysed. A detailed account of the type of interaction between the protease and the molecules is discussed. The majority of hit compounds displayed appreciable binding affinities on coronavirus protease. Three hit compounds possess structures similar to that of natural products, viz., flavonoids, and nucleoside. These molecules were hydrophilic and slightly deviated from Lipinski parameters. All other derived molecules obeyed the Lipinski rule. <i>In vitro</i>, <i>in vivo,</i> and toxicological studies of these compounds have to be performed before checking the actual druggability of these compounds.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aps/2020/8818008/","createdAt":"2020-09-28T19:22:47.242Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T19:22:47.242Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f723807e555c9747593cc9d","title":"Changes in Gut Microorganism in Patients with Positive Immune Antibody-Associated Recurrent Abortion","abstract":"<i>Background</i>. This study is aimed at analyzing the changes in gut microorganism of patients with positive immune antibody-associated recurrent abortion using the 16s rRNA gene sequencing microbiome assay. <i>Methods</i>. The fecal samples from 20 recurrent abortion women with positive immune antibody (positive group) and 20 with negative immune antibody (negative group) were collected. After 16s rRNA gene sequencing, the obtained raw reads underwent quality filtering to obtain the clean tags and then classified into microbial genomes. All effective tags were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and the representative sequence was selected for the annotation of taxonomic information, followed by alpha and beta diversity analyses. <i>Results</i>. A total of 43,116 OTUs were obtained in all 40 samples. <i>Bacteroides</i> had the highest relative abundance in the positive group. In the negative group, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Erysipelotrichaceae</i>_UCG-003, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, and <i>Prevotella_9</i> had high relative abundance.

In this study, the effect of timosaponin BII extracted from <i>Anemarrhena asphodeloides</i> on hair growth of C57BL/6 mice was investigated by measuring the hair follicle morphology, hair growth length and area in C57BL/6 male mice, and the immunohistochemical analysis of <i>&#x03B2;</i>-catenin, Wnt3a, and Wnt10b in the dorsal skins of mice after topical application with minoxidil and timosaponin BII for 15 days. The decrease in skin brightness, the increase in the regrowing area of hair and hair follicles numbers, and the improvement of hair follicle morphology in the group applied with 0.5&#x0025; timosaponin BII indicated an induction of the anagen phase in telogenic mice skin, which were comparative to the 2&#x0025; minoxidil treatment. The immunohistochemical analysis detected an increase in the expression of <i>&#x03B2;</i>-catenin and Wnt10b, supporting the theory of the activation of the <i>&#x03B2;</i>-catenin/Wnt pathway was one of the pathways that are related to anagen phase induction. <i>Anemarrhena asphodeloides</i> is a herb commonly used for metabolic disorders in China.

Nanotechnology has prompted the development of multifunctional material. In this research, we aim to synthesize a nanoparticle that can eliminate periodontal pathogenic microorganisms and simultaneously stimulate new bone tissue regeneration and mineralization. QAS-modified core-shell mesoporous silica containing Ag nanoparticles (Ag@QHMS) was successfully synthesized through the classic hydrothermal method and surface quaternary ammonium salt functionalization. The Ag@QHMS in vitro antibacterial activity was explored via coculture with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> biofilms. Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were selected for observing cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and osteogenic differentiation. Ag@QHMS showed a good sustained release profile of Ag<sup>+</sup> and a QAS-grafted mesoporous structure. Compared with the single-contact antibacterial activity of QHMS, Ag@QHMS exhibited a more efficient and stable concentration-dependent antimicrobial efficacy; the minimum inhibitory concentration was within 100&#x2009;<i>&#x03BC;</i>g/ml, which was below the BMSC biocompatibility concentration (200&#x2009;<i>&#x03BC;</i>g/ml). Thus, apoptosis would not occur while promoting the increased expression of osteogenic-associated factors, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and collagen type 1 (COL-1). A safe concentration of particles can stimulate cell alkaline phosphatase and matrix calcium salt deposition. The dual antibacterial effect from the direct contact killing of QAS and the sustained release of Ag nanoparticles, along with the Ag-promoted osteogenic differentiation, had been verified and utilized in Ag@QHMS. This system demonstrates the potential for utilizing pluripotent biomaterials to treat complex lesions.","year":"2020","link":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/4567049/","createdAt":"2020-09-28T19:22:47.242Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T19:22:47.242Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f723807e555c9747593cca0","title":"Break the Spasm with Succinylcholine, but Risk Intraoperative Awareness with Undiagnosed Pseudocholinesterase Deficiency","abstract":"Succinylcholine is a commonly used medication in all aspects of anesthetic care, and there are a number of known side effects and complications associated with its use.

For the treatment of mild to moderate flares of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, Mesalazine has been used as the first line drug in both western and Asian countries due to its superiority over other drugs in terms of side effects and toxicities. Besides, some other drugs are also prescribed for total resolution of different symptoms of ulcerative colitis and associated diseases, which include Acetaminophen, Metronidazole and Vitamin D3. Moreover, physicians instruct that Mesalazine should be taken at least one hour before meal. So, there are enough scopes of studying the drug-food interaction of Mesalazine to assess if there is any incompatibility present with food. Thus, in the present study, Mesalazine and physical mixtures of Mesalazine (1:1) in solid form along with the aforementioned drugs were prepared and analyzed to evaluate the compatibility among them using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). In addition, interactions of Mesalazine with food stocks such as chicken and vegetable broth, fruit juice, milk and soybean oil were studied using FTIR, considering these as the common sources of protein, vitamin, fiber, minerals and fat. From this study, it was interpreted that, major interactions of Mesalazine were present with food samples.

Similarly, remarkably improved hemoglobin (+20.10%), and decreased HbA1c (−48.44%) was observed when compared to diabetic control rats. The extract also caused reduced serum enzyme (ALT, ALP, bilirubin) levels and produced a succeeding recovery toward their normal values.It can be concluded from these investigations that the in-vitro and in-vivo hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activity offers the methodicaljustification for the use of S. media in herb based anti-diabetic treatment.Video Clip of Methodology:Alpha-amylase inhibitory activity: 14 min 17 sec:&nbsp;&nbsp;Click to watch","year":" 2019-04-28 ","createdAt":"2020-10-04T10:44:09.820Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T10:44:09.820Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f79a7795030ef32dc584d4d","title":"Dose-dependent response to phytobiotic supplementation in feed on growth, hematology, intestinal pH, and gut bacterial load in broiler chicken","link":"https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/JAVAR/article/view/41770","abstract":"Objective: The present study was aimed to evaluate dose-dependent effects of phytobiotic (Galibiotic) supplements in feed on growth performance, hematological parameters, intestinal pH, and gut bacterial population in broiler chick.Materials and Methods: A total of 50 ten day old broiler chicks were divided into five groups, namely, Group A as control (without galibiotic), Group B (galibiotic at 1 gm/kg feed), Group C (gal­ibiotic at 2 gm/kg feed), Group D (galibiotic at 5 gm/kg feed), and Group E (galibiotic at 10 gm/kg feed). All the birds were reared for 42 days and samples were collected before and after sacrifice.Results: Live body weights showed no significant differences between the groups but overall feed conversion ratios (FCRs) of treatment groups were significantly low in Group E having the lowest. Blood samples collected for hematology differed significantly (p < 0.01) among the different groups. Intestinal pH was lower in treatment groups with Group E having the lowest. Cecal total viable count was highest in Group A and lowest in Group E. The cecal coliform count was low in all the treatment groups.Conclusion: Along with previously published report, it may conclude that the phytobiotic could be used as an alternative to antibiotics due to positive growth performance, lower FCR, carcass quality, and improved gut health of broiler chicks.J.

All the groups were fed a basal diet until day 7. However, the NTC and treat­ment groups were fed a diet with MgCl2 from days 8 to 42.Results: The addition of MgCl2 for 35 days worsened the growth performance traits in broilers and induced wet litter problems (FPL, high LCM, and poor CC) in the NTC group. However, PHF (750, 1,000, and 2,000 gm/ton) ameliorated the negative effect of a diet with MgCl2 on growth perfor­mance and wet litter problems, but a better response with respect to LCM and CC was observed in 2,000 gm/ton of PHF group, followed by that in 1,000 gm/ton of PHF group and 750 gm/ton of PHF group on day 42.Conclusion: The wet litter broiler model was developed through excessive feeding of MgCl2, which caused the performance parameters to worsen and the emergence of problems associated with the wet litter.

The fastest growing metabolic disorder, diabetes mellitus (DM), is now a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. All the associated complications produced in diabetes are mainly caused by the imbalance between generation of free radicals and the antioxidant systems like catalase (CAT) and super oxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes. Again increased level of serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) are considered a consequence of hepatocyte damage due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and patients with diabetes have an increased risk NAFLD and steatohepatitis.

The test results using LMIA on L3H. contortus showed the lowest inhibition in the negative control. Among the species of Cassia, the C. surattensis (at 200 mg/ml) showed the highest (p < 0.05) inhibition level on the larvae. The latter result corresponded to the effect of albendazole.Conclusion: Compared to other Cassia spp., C. surattensis exhibited the highest inhibition against L3 H. contortus. However, the inhibition effect of C. surattensis was still lower as compared to albendazole.J. Adv. Vet. Anim.

A total of 6,724 lycaenids was recorded from Butterfly Research Park at Bhawal National Park, Gazipur; Madhupur National Park, Tangail; Satchori National Park and Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary of Habigonj. The dominant species was Arhopala pseudocentaurus with 21.85% relative frequency and the least abundant species was Rathinda amor with 0.75% relative frequency. Butterfly Research Park showed the maximum number of butterfly individuals with a covariance of 40% followed by Madhupur National Park (37%), Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary (13%), and Satchori National Park (10%). A significant difference (F = 3.52, p-value = 0.02) has been assessed using „One-way ANOVA‟ test. The difference in the availability of butterflies in different habitats indicated the differences in plant diversity among the forests. Lycaenid butterflies displayed highest abundance (13.19%) in December and lowest (5.38%) in October. There was no significant difference (F = 0.72, p-value = 0.71) among different months throughout the study period in overall species abundance though highest number was recorded in December. The abiotic factors (viz. temperature and relative humidity etc.) influence the presence of butterflies. Lycaenid butterflies demonstrated the highest abundance (887) in 26.9°C along with 64% relative humidity whereas the least abundance (362) has been recorded at 31.7°C with 77% relative humidity. The significant negative correlation was found in between lycaenid abundance and temperature (r = ─ 0.45, pvalue = 0.14), and between lycaenid abundance and relative humidity (r = ─ 0.19, p-value = 0.54). The butterfly population increased with decreasing average temperature and relative humidity during the study period.

Aloe vera, a documented medicative plant, is used for numerous medical and cosmetic applications since very beginning of the civilization. An experiment was conducted in Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture (BINA), Mymensingh to find out the most appropriate soil for A. vera cultivation. Seven types of soils viz., acid, calcareous, non-calcareous, charland, saline, peat and acid sulphate were collected from different locations of Bangladesh. Eighteenth month old Aloe vera seedlings were collected from Shomvogonj, Mymensingh and planted during last week of May, 2017 following completely randomized design (CRD) with three replications. Most of the soils were light grey in colour, acidic to neutral in nature and clay to clay loam in texture except non-calcareous and charland soils. Bulk density, particle density and field capacity ranged from 1.23−1.45 g cm−3, 2.20−2.58 g cm−3 and 27.07−30.20%, respectively. The ranges of pH, EC and organic matter contents were 3.8 to 7.8, 0.25 to 14.04 dS m−1 and 0.88 to 16.40%, respectively. The organic matter content was found as low to moderate except peat soil. Total N, exchangeable K, available P and S contents ranged from 0.05−0.95%, 0.17−0.73 cmol kg−1, 3.09−12.10 and 11.06−735.12 µg g−1 soil, respectively. Growth and leaf biomass yield of A. vera was significantly influenced by different soil types. The highest plant height, leaf number, leaf area and leaf fresh weight were recorded from the plant grown in non-calcareous soil whereas maximum fresh gel weight, dry leaf weight and yield increase over acid sulphate soil were found from the plant grown in calcareous soil. The highest fresh leaf gel weight (907 g plant−1) was obtained from the plant grown in calcareous soil which was identical with the gel weight (880 g plant−1) of the plant grown in acid soil. The yield increase of acid, non-calcareous, charland, saline1 (6.32 dS m−1) and saline2 (8.14 dS m−1) soils over acid sulphate soil were 718, 712, 394, 144 and 86%, respectively. The overall performance of the soils in relation to leaf biomass yield was of the following order: calcareous ≥ acid ≥ non-calcareous > charland > saline1 (6.32 dS m−1) > saline2 (8.14 dS m−1) > peat > acid sulphate soil. The results suggest that farmers could be advised to grow A. vera either in calcareous or acid soils of Bangladesh. Since calcareous and non-calcareous soils are mostly used for growing cereals, pulses, cash crop like sugarcane, fruits etc., acid soil could be used for cultivating this important medicinal crop considering the socio-economic conditions of the country.J.

Conventional cardioprotective drugs are effective but expensive and associated with a number of side effects. Curcuma longa is an important source of traditional medicine for the prevention and treatment of CVDs. The objective of the study was to evaluate the protective effect of Curcuma longa on isoproterenol induced myocardial injury in rats. This experimental study was carried out in the Department of Physiology, Dhaka Medical College, Dhaka during 2015. Total 21 Wistar albino male rats, aged 85 to 100 days, weighing 100 to 150 g (initial body weight) were selected for the study. After acclimatization for 14 days, the rats were divided into three groups. Group A (base line control group), Group B (isoproterenol treated control group) and Group C (Curcuma longa pretreated and isoproterenol treated group). Each group consisted of 7 rats. On the 10th day of experiment, rats were sacrificed after taking final body weight. Blood samples were collected from the heart. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was estimated by Colorimetric method and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was estimated by ELISA method. The statistical analysis was done by one way ANOVA and Bonferroni test as applicable.&nbsp; In this study, the mean initial and final body weight of the rats were almost similar and showed no statistically significant difference among the groups. The mean serum AST and LDH levels were significantly (P<0.001) higher in Group B than those of Group A. Again, these levels were significantly (P<0.001) lower in Group C than those of Group B group. From the results, it can be concluded that Curcuma longa has cardioprotective activity on isoproterenol induced myocardial injury in Wistar albino rats.Bangladesh Med J. 2018 Jan; 47 (3): 13-17","year":" 2019-10-10 ","createdAt":"2020-10-04T11:04:26.164Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T11:04:26.164Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f79ac3ae19dbf654403354d","title":"Effect of Hyssopus officinalis essential oil on chronic stress-induced memory and learning impairment in male mice","link":"https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJP/article/view/33585","abstract":"The present study investigated the effect of H. officinalis essential oil on avoidance memory in chronic stress-induced.

Shoti from Bangladesh Agricultural University campus was collected and sorted on the basis of white color of the rhizome. Then they were chopped into pieces, sun dried and pulverized in a flour mill. Aliquot samples were autoclaved at 1200C under 15 lb of pressure per square inch for 30 min. Autoclaved samples were stored in tightly lid contained for future use. 3 One hundred -day-old Cobb 500 broiler chicks were reared on the floor and a total of 24 growing broilers, 4 birds in each group were weighed on d 15 Two broilers were placed in each cage. There were a total of four experimental and two control (positive and negative Non-protein control) diets. Diets were fed ad libitum from day 15 to 33days. Body weight, feed intake, feed refusal and fecal weights were recorded every day. Cumulative feed efficiency per bird was calculated as the ratio of weight gained to feed consumed. Dry matter of excreta was determined from the last 10 d of feeding trial by drying aliquots of every day’s droppings by drying for 6 h at 1050C. On d 19, birds were bled to death. Immediately after slaughter, the carcasses were examined systematically. The chemical composition of Shoti meal showed that it is low in protein, fat and trace minerals and therefore mainly a source of energy. The bulk of the tuber (75 percent) consists of carbohydrates, made up of 10.6% fiber, and 64.9% nitrogen free extracts (NFE). A peculiarity of Curcuma rhizome meal contains high level of ash (9.9%) on DM basis. The results showed that at day 33, the weight of the broiler chicken fed shoti 100g, 200g, 300 g and 200g (autoclaved shoti meal)/ Kg diet was significantly different from the weight of the chicken fed on a maize-soybean diet. The birds given shoti meal consumed less feed than those provided with a maize diet. Feed efficiency or weight gain to feed ration over 19-d period was the poorest when fed 300 g Shoti/ Kg diet. Intake picked up when the shoti meal was incorporated after having been autoclaved and there was slight improvement in body weight gain as compared to that of other Shoti fed group. However, feed efficiency and body weight gain as % of initial weight remained significantly lower than the maize-soybean control. The inclusion of Shoti meal generally had an adverse effect on the apparent dry matter digestibility compared with the control diets. The group fed autoclaved shoti meal had a similar effect and the true N digestibility was the lowest when compared to those of control fed on maize-soybean meal. Thus, physical treatment like using autoclave, caused further reduction of digestibility of its N. Lipid digestibility was reduced by ingestion of shoti meal. Since the diets were isocaloric, after correction for the apparent endogenous lipid losses, which were obtained from the results of non-protein control feeding, the net faecal losses was around 66.2% of the ingested lipid against control diet fed birds.Bang.

In the rural areas, most of the parents seek traditional rather than modern medical facilities. They seek treatment when symptoms get worse.Objective: To find out the pattern of morbidities and health seeking behaviour of under five children. In order to achieve the goal it was focused on some of the key factors that may be closely related with the pattern of morbidities and treatment seeking behaviour.Materials and Methods: This was a cross sectional descriptive study conducted from 15 October 2014 to 15 March 2015 in Mohishashi village of Dhamrai Upazila, Dhaka District and Balihati village of Saturia Upazila, Manikganj district. Sample size was 350, obtained by non-probability, purposive sampling technique. The study was conducted by using a verbal questionnaire which was semi-structured close-ended in nature and a measuring tape for Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC). The people of some purposively selected villages were taken as sample, so the results can not be generalised for the rural communities of Bangladesh.Results: The findings revealed that the majority (62%) of the children became ill at least 3 times a year. Cough and cold were most common symptoms in 315(58.01%) cases. Varieties of healthcare facilities are available in the community, among those hospital/ clinic had been availed most often which account to 277(65.95%). Amongst study cases, 190(45.23%) cases availed this facility due to effective and safe treatment and 181(43.09%) due to easy availability of health care service. The immunization status of children were 349(99.71%), though 256 (73.14%) children were completely immunized and 93(26.57%) were incomplete due to age constrains or other reason. This study shows that 220 (62.86%) children had not been hospitalized since birth for any reason. Among the admitted children, 74 out of 130 (37.14%) received their treatment from government hospitals after being sick.Conclusion: This study indicates that the health seeking behaviour of the parents of under five children in Dhamrai and Saturia Upazila is satisfactory. In order to reduce unwanted and unacceptable child mortality it is needed to build a better concept of healthcare in the rural areas.Journal of Armed Forces Medical College Bangladesh Vol.11(2) 2015: 55-60","year":" 2019-01-16 ","createdAt":"2020-10-04T11:06:32.568Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T11:06:32.568Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f79acb8e19dbf654403358c","title":"Age, Sex and Seasonal Variations of Dermatosis Attending in Dermatology Department of A Tertiary Care Hospital","link":"https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/CMOSHMCJ/article/view/39777","abstract":"Background: Dermatological problems are common among patients of different ages visiting the out patient departments of tertiary care centers.

The first step in evaluating a patient with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the clinical assessment of pretest probability. American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines recommend the use of Diamond and Forrester Method (DFM) or Duke Clinical Score (DCS) for calculating Pretest Probability Score (PPS). Myocardial Perfusion study (MPI) can calculate the Summed Stress Score (SSS), an index obtained by adding the individual scores derived from the 17 segments. This study was performed to assess the agreement between the established PPS with SSS so that it can help in risk stratification.Patients and Methods: This cross-sectional observational study was carried out in National Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Science (NINMAS), BSMMU from July 2016 to June 2017. A total of 89 suspected or known CAD patients were included in this study. PPS was calculated by Duke clinical scoring from brief clinical history. SSS was calculated by nuclear medicine software while performing Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI). Statistical analyses were carried out by using the IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0.0 (IBM Corporation Software Group Somers, NY). Pearson correlation and Bland & Altman analyses were applied for assessing correlation and agreement between PPS and SSS. Degree of relation between variables is expressed by ‘r’ (Pearson’s correlation coefficient).Results: The mean of PPS was found 14.73 ± 3.35 and that of SSS was found 16 ± 14.01.&nbsp; A positive correlation (r=0.108; p=0.312) between PPS and SSS. With Bland and Altman analysis, it was observed that mean difference of PPS and SSS was -1.27 ± 14.045. The limit of agreement ranged from -28.798 to 26.259. There was a positive correlation between PPS and SSS. Mean difference between the two scores was small. The bias between the scores was not significant. The differences within mean ± 1.96 SD were not statistically significant.Conclusion: This study shows PPS and SSS can be used interchangeably. This analysis of agreement between PPS and SSS can further enhance prediction of CAD and upgrade the utilization of SSS for risk stratification in CAD patients, which will influence therapeutic management of the patients and play a major role to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.Bangladesh J.

The magnitude of hypothyroidism at community level in Bangladesh is unknown except some clinic-based studies. The present study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of hypothyroidism in different occupational groups of Bangladeshi population and to assess the risks related to it.Study design: Three occupational groups (house-wives, college students, rickshaw-pullers) of native Bangladeshi population were purposively selected. Investigations included socio-demography, anthropometry, blood pressure and biochemistry [fasting blood glucose, lipids, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxin (FT4)]. Laboratory tests were done only on a randomized sample of participants.Results: Overall, 626 (M/F=123 / 503) participants with a mean age of 35.9 (34.75 – 37.02) years volunteered. The mean values of all participant for TSH and FT4 were 2.08 (95%CI: 1.72 – 2.45) μiu/ml and 13.04 (95CI:12.86 – 13.22) pmol/L respectively. The third percentile of TSH ranged from 0.42 to 0.46 μiu/ml and 97th percentile ranged from 5.16 to 5.24 μiu/ml. For FT4, the 3rd and the 97th percentile were 10.3 and 16.41 pmol/L, respectively. The prevalence of hypothyroidism in both sexes was 7.0% (M/F=4.1/8.3%). Occupational groups, sex and increasing age, obesity, blood pressure, and lipids showed no association with hypothyroidism. Hyperglycemia was proved to be a significant risk for hypothyroidism (prevalence in diabetic vs. non-diabetic was12.9% vs. 5.5%, p = 0.04; FBG was correlated with TSH, r = 0.138, p <0.001).Conclusions: It is concluded that the prevalence of hypothyroidism was almost equal to other studies. Hypothyroidism was not related to increasing age, obesity, blood pressure and lipids. It was found to affect all sexes, all social classes and all occupational groups. Hyperglycemia was evidently found as significant risk for hypothyroidism.Ibrahim Med. Coll.

A total of 200 patients were selected following the convenient method of sampling from National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital. Dhaka. Face to face interviews were taken from the diagnosed breast cancer patients admitted in the hospital. Forty five percent patients were illiterate and 83% were house wife. The mean age was 42 and mean monthly family income was around 9000 taka. Two thirds of the respondents were present with locally advance stage (stage III) and three fourth of the patients identified the lump as 1st symptom. Four of 10 patients first sought help to homeopathy for their cancer diagnosis and treatment. Mean help seeking time was 11 months. Nine out of 10 patients were agreed with the statement, ‘I was healthy’. Maximum respondents (81.0%) agreed with the statement, ‘wait and see what would be happened’. Results showed that there was a relationship between delay help seeking and the statement of perception. There were significant associations between the perception on expensive treatment, perception on ‘I am healthy’, perception on ‘lump related with menstruation’, perception on ‘wait and see what would be happened’, perception on ‘feared to do operation, it may cause death’ and perception on family income and the delay in help seeking. Along with perception on breast cancer use of alternative medicine, lack of social support, health care delivery system, economic factor etc. influence the pattern and delay in help seeking.

One hundred fifteen 3rd year students were selected by purposive and convenient method and asked to respond anonymously to a 18 item selfadministered, predesigned, pretested multiple choice questionnaire which dealt with their views on autopsy practice, the knowledge procedure, attitude and perception towards post mortem examination. Ethical permission of authority concerned and verbal consent was obtained from every respondent students.Results: In this study, 108(93.91 %) students gave positive answer about the requirement of autopsy in unnatural death cases. A large number of students 57(49.56%) did not know about the types of autopsy, but more than half 67(58.26%) knew about virtual autopsy. Seventy two (62.61%) answered that heart is the organ sent for histopathological examination and majority 71(61.74%) could identify the viscera sent for chemical analysis. But most of them 65(56.52%) had wrong idea about the laboratory for chemical analysis. Also 70(60.87%) thought that formalin is used for preservation of viscera.

Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation are noxious stimuli, which cause a reflex increase in both sympathetic and sympathoadrenal activity that may result in tachycardia, hypertension and dysarrhythmias. Insertion of Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is associated with less haemodynamic changes, minimal increase in intraocular and intracranial pressure and lower incidence of sore throat. Still its insertion requires sufficient depth of anesthesia to prevent airway reflex (gagging, coughing nd spasms). To insert LMA successfully propofol is the most frequently administered medication. But most of all recommend not using propofol singly for LMA insertion. Thiopental can’t suppress the upper airway reflexes as propofol but with low dose succinylcholine upper airway reflexes are attenuated so combination of thiopental sodium with succinylcholine may be another choice of drug.Objectives: This Prospective study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Thiopental sodium and Succinylcholine for insertion of the LMA in comparison with Propofol.Methods: This interventional study was carried out in Sixty patients, aged 3-45 years who were scheduled for elective surgical procedure under general anaesthesia in ShSMCH. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups by odd and even number basis. In Group-1 (N1=30), LMA was inserted after induction with Thiopental sodium (5 mg/kg body weight i.v.) and Succinylcholine (0.5mg/kg i.v); in Group-2 (N2 = 30), the LMA was inserted with Propofol (2.5mg/kg i.v). Jaw relaxation, incidence of coughing- gagging , overall insertion condition and haemodynamic changes were observed.Results: Grade of jaw relaxation in Group-1 was Good in 93.3%, incomplete in 6.7% and 0% poor but in Group-2, 86.7% was good 10% incomplete and 3.3% was poor. Coughing occurred in 33.3% of patients in the Group-2 and there was only 10% in succinyl group (P=0.028) which is significantly higher in Group-2. Overall insertion condition in Group -1 was excellent in 86.7%, Good in 10% cases and poor in only 3.3% cases on the other hand in Group-2 excellent in 53.3%, Good in 33.3% cases and poor in only 13.3% cases (P=0.019).Conclusion: There was statistically significant difference in jaw relaxation in two groups and incidence of Gagging or Coughing is higher in Group-2. Overall insertion condition was significantly better in Group-1.

The measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) of spine and hip using central dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the most standard technique to diagnose osteoporosis. But in many circumstances, measurement of spine or hip BMD is quite difficult to carry out where wrist BMD can be used as an alternative. Moreover, wrist BMD can be done with smaller, cheaper, portable peripheral devices for screening osteoporosis at primary health care level. The objective of the study was to explore the agreement of wrist BMD with spine and hip BMD in postmenopausal women.Patients and Methods: This observational, cross sectional study was carried out at National Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (NINMAS), Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University&nbsp;(BSMMU) campus, from July 2017 to June 2018. A total of 110 postmenopausal women referred to NINMAS for BMD measurement were enrolled in this study after fulfilling selection criteria.&nbsp; BMD of spine, right and left hip and wrist of enrolled subjects were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan by Stratos DR Bone densitometer.Results: &nbsp;Agreement analysis done by kappa statistics revealed kappa value of 0.930 (p<0.05), 0.782 (p<0.05) and 0.635 (p<0.05) between wrist and spine BMD, wrist and right hip BMD and wrist and left hip BMD, respectively. In Bland-Altman analysis, the mean difference of T-score measured by wrist and spine was -0.007 ± 1.361, wrist and right hip was -0.645 ± 1.271 and wrist and left hip was -0.450 ± 1.259 with 95% of differences were found in between -2.674 and 2.660, -3.136 and 1.846 and -2.917 and 2.017, respectively. Positive significant Pearson’s correlation was observed between wrist BMD and spine BMD (r=0.664; p=0.001), wrist BMD and right hip BMD (r=0.719; p=0.001) and wrist BMD and left hip BMD (r=0.727; p=0.001).Conclusion: This study results showed an excellent kappa agreement between wrist and spine BMD with good kappa agreement of wrist with right and left hip BMD as well as in Bland-Altman analysis, the mean differences of T-score between wrist andspine, wrist and right hip and wrist and left hip were small. The biases between the methods were considered not significant suggesting that these sites can be used interchangeably for measurement of BMD. Hence, wrist BMD can be used with regular skeletal sites (spine and hip) as an effective method of diagnosing osteopenia and osteoporosis by DXA where spine or hip BMD is difficult to carry out as well as it can be used for osteoporosis screening at primary health care level by portable peripheral DXA device to initiate early treatment to reduce fracture risks.Bangladesh J.

The all bone fractures were corrected using standard techniques while left proximal ureter injury was treated as conservation medical therapy. One month later, contrast media were also found in proximal ureter and abdomen which indicated ureter rupture. This rupture was corrected surgically by nephrovesical subcutaneous ureteric bypass (SUB) under fluoroscopy guidance.Results: First day after accidental injury, the serum BUN and CRE were 10.7 mg/dL and 0.9 mg/dL, respectively which indicated kidney injury but by conservative therapy these parameters were lowered gradually. On the 5th day after considering these parameters, the dog was judged normal. However, on the 31st day BUN and CRE were 14.3 mg/dL and 0.8 mg/Kg, respectively. The Doppler ultrasonography revealed hydroneprosis, proximal ureter stenosis and high resistive index (0.72±0.02) in the renal arcuate artery indicating renal abnormalities due to ureter obstruction.

In a normal individual oxygen saturation (SpO2) is at least 95% and patient feels shortness of breath when SpO2 falls below 90% with some exception. SARS-CoV-2, a newly emergent coronavirus has the peculiarity to produce silent hypoxia, meaning SpO2< 90% or less like 80%, 70%, 60% without shortness of breath. Silent hypoxia can be diagnosed by monitoring SpO2 with pulse oximeter. For management of COVID-19, early symptoms like fever & cough, SpO2 should be monitored by pulse oximeter, followed by immediate correction of hypoxia by O2 supplementation and prophylactic oral or injectable anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolism and thus death rate can be reduced.Case summary: A 72-year-old man presented with the complaints of fever and headache followed by cough, fatigue, anorexia, loss of taste and appetite in next few days but no shortness of breath. The patient was clinically diagnosed as a case of COVID-19 & positive result of Real time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test confirmed the diagnosis. From the first day, SpO2 was regularly monitored with pulse oximeter and SpO2 on day 1, it was 96-98%. On day 8, SpO2 fell to 89-93%, pulse 96/min, respiratory rate>30/min, temperature 101° F, taste sensation was reduced. According to sign and symptoms, the patient was diagnosed as COVID-19 with severe pneumonia. Management was started at home with continuous monitoring, lying in prone position for 5-6 hours/day, supplemental oxygenation to maintain level of SpO2 between 94-96%, injectable anticoagulant enoxaparin to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was given. Prophylactic antibiotics and symptomatic treatment were also given.Results: According to this case report, patient’s SpO2 was monitored by pulse oximeter on first day; on day 08, SpO2 fell to 89-93% & on day 10, further dropped to 85-88% which indicated severe pneumonia but there was no complaint of breathlessness as it was silent hypoxia. Sometimes the patient spent 30 minutes or more in toilet and SpO2 used to fall to 82-83% without any subjective shortness of breath but with only mild heaviness of chest and cough. Therefore SpO2 monitoring by pulse oximeter is essential in early diagnosis of silent hypoxia. Correction of hypoxia by supplemental oxygenation and prevention of VTE and DIC by using anticoagulant was the mainstay of treatment and patient had significant improvement on day 14. The patient was managed completely at home except X-ray being done in a hospital.Conclusion: Fall of SpO2 in COVID-19 i.e. hypoxia (usually present as shortness of breath) or silent hypoxia can be diagnosed early by pulse oximeter or smart phone pulse oximetry apps. Early management by isolation, supplemental oxygenation and oral/injectable anticoagulation can prevent further events like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure followed by multiple organ failure (that may cause death).

Serum creatinine is a very common tool of renal assessment in diabetic nephropathy. This study aims at observation of existing correlation between serum creatinine and urine albumin in diabetic nephropathy patients. This cross sectional observational study has been conducted on 50 diabetic patients admitted to medicine department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Patients were included in this study after fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria in a period January 2018 to June 2018. After selection, data were collected by structured questionnaire. Then 24 hour urinary total protein, urine for microalbumin, complete blood count, fasting blood sugar, two hours postprandial blood sugar, HbA1C, serum creatinine report were collected and analyzed it with the help of SPSS 16.0 MS excel. Among total 50 patients, 34 patients were diagnosed on the basis of microalbuminuria and the rest were found to have raised urinary total protein. The male patients were 54 percent of the total population. Most of the patients were in between the age of 57 to 67 years. The r value is insignificant in two graphs where serum creatinine was compared with urine microalbumin and serum creatinine respectively, which suggests absence of linear or any other correlation between these two components. The estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) was calculated by MDRD equation individually. Staging was done on the base of eGFR. Only 41.37% of the patients with microalbuminuria, showed eGFR consistent with its staging while only 31.5% of the patients with proteinuria showed respective expected eGFR. And the difference between the mean serum creatinine in two groups was insignificant. This study has shown that, the serum creatinine has no linear correlation with urinary albumin in diabetic nephropathy patients. So, commonly used serum creatinine based formula to calculate the estimated GFR cannot reflect the amount of urinary protein excretion all the time. So it can misinterpret the staging of the disease which can delay the appropriate treatment of the patient.J Dhaka Medical College, Vol. 27, No.2, October, 2018, Page 141-147","year":" 2020-03-10 ","createdAt":"2020-10-04T11:08:11.479Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T11:08:11.479Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f79ad1be19dbf65440335be","title":"A Comparison of Ultra Sound Therapy and Micro Wave Diathermy on Patients with Adhesive Capsulitis of Shoulder Joint","link":"https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/JAFMC/article/view/39820","abstract":"Introduction: Adhesive capsulitis is one of the most common causes of pain and disability of the shoulder joint. Most patients are managed conservatively in a primary care setting with the expectation of a good outcome. There are many alternative forms of treatment for this condition.

The presence of phosphate increases the surfactant removal efficacy of vermicompost. The pH values for vermicompost amended systems were almost constant near 7. The electrical conductivity of vermicompost amended systems was found to increase with time whereas that for the control systems was almost constant. Therefore, vermicompost can be considered as an excellent amendment as they have the ability to remove surfactant in surface water correcting the pH and increasing the availability of nutrients of the systems.","year":" 2020-05-01 ","createdAt":"2020-10-04T11:09:30.029Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T11:09:30.029Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f79ad6ae19dbf65440335d5","title":"Investigation of Water Quality and Fish Status of Karimganj Haor Area in Kishoreganj","link":"https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/JESNR/article/view/39009","abstract":"The study was conducted to investigate the physicochemical parameters and anionic constituents in water of the haor area of Karimganj during the period from October to December 2016.

Extensive review of the literature showed that two mechanisms, namely Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) dependent and independent mechanisms, are mainly responsible for multi drug resistant (MDR) CML. In Bangladesh, it is difficult to identify the exact mechanism of development of drug resistance in CML. In a few cases, sample from CML patients are sent overseas to detect any new mutation in TKI binding domain of BCR – ABL fusion gene but it is not possible to find out other mechanisms responsible for drug resistance in CML.Conclusion: To overcome the drug resistance in CML, it is important to use the conventional drugs used in the treatment of CML meticulously and regularly as irregular use and discontinuation of treatment will permit the development of drug resistance.Journal of Armed Forces Medical College Bangladesh Vol.12(2) 2016: 135-140","year":" 2016-12-01 ","createdAt":"2020-10-04T11:10:28.866Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T11:10:28.866Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f79ada4e19dbf65440335e8","title":"Bryostatin I inhibits growth of breast cancer cells through the inhibition of synuclein-A expression","link":"https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJP/article/view/26620","abstract":"The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of bryostatin I on the expression of synuclein-A in breast cancer cells.

It is a vitamin K antagonist composed of S- and R- isomers. The more potent S-warfarin is metabolized by cytochrome 450 isoenzyme 2C9 (CYP2C9), encoded by CYP2C9 gene. Warfarin exerts its anticoagulants effect by inhibitingits target enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), encoded by vitamin K epoxide reductase subunit 1 (VKOR1) gene. Genetic variation in the CYP2C9 and VKOR1 gene can affect warfarin efficacy and dose required to achieve stable International Normalization Ratio (INR). Specifically two variants in the CYP2CP gene (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3) result in an enzyme with reduced activity, leading to increased active warfarin levels. A variant in the VKORC1 gene (VKORC1-1639 G>A) can lead to reduced gene expression resulting in decresed level of VKOR. Together these three variants can account for 40-70% of the variability of warfarin dose. Carriers of variant alleles are at higher risk for bleeding complications, particularly at the induction of warfarin therapy. So, genotype-guided dosing algorithms would be better approximate for maintenance of warfarin dose than fixed-dose algorithms.University Heart Journal Vol. 15, No. 2, Jul 2019; 74-78","year":" 2019-08-19 ","createdAt":"2020-10-04T11:10:54.307Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T11:10:54.307Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f79adbee19dbf65440335ef","title":"Antidepressant activity of Nyctanthes arbor-tristis in mice","link":"https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJP/article/view/26682","abstract":"The present study assesses the protective effect of Nyctanthes arbor-tristis (Nyctaginaceae) extracts and in combination with fluoxetine on stress-induced depression in mice.

The compound displayed excellent dose-dependent ɑ-amylase (28.0-92.0%), ɑ-glucosidase (40.3-93.1%) and hemoglobin glycosylation (9.0%-54.9%) inhibitory effects and promoted the uptake of glucose by the yeast cells (0.2 to 26.3%). The treatment of the isoniazid- and rifampicin- (p.o., 50 mg/kg of each) intoxicated rats with OXCPM (100 mg/kg, p.o.) resulted in restoring the normal serum levels of the non-enzymatic (total bilirubin, total protein and albumin) and bringing about a remarkable decrease in the levels of enzymatic (alanine transaminases, aspartate transaminases and alkaline phosphatase) biomarkers. The molecular docking studies indicated high binding affinity of the compound for hyperglycemia-related protein targets; fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, beta2-adrenergic receptors and glucokinase. The results indicate that OXCPM may not only reduce hyperglycemia by enzyme inhibition but also the disease complications through protection of hemoglobin glycosylation and hepatic injury.Video Clip of Methodology:Glucose uptake by yeast cells:&nbsp; &nbsp;4 min 51 sec&nbsp; &nbsp;Click to watch","year":" 2018-05-10 ","createdAt":"2020-10-04T11:10:54.307Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T11:10:54.307Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f79adbee19dbf65440335f2","title":"Dapoxetine for the management of premature ejaculation","link":"https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/bjpsy/article/view/45367","abstract":"Premature ejaculation is the most prevalent male sexual disorder and is more common in South Asia. Bangladesh is no exception. Premature ejaculation causes dissatisfaction in the relationship, frustration for the patient and partner as well as reason of marital failure. Since 1970s sex therapy was the mode of treatment for premature ejaculation. Now treatment with drugs also seems effective. Now a days dapoxetine is used in Bangladesh for the treatment of premature ejaculation. The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of dapoxetine in patients with premature ejaculation. It was a prospective study conducted in private chamber of Dhaka city during the period of March 2016 to February 2017. A total of 60 patients within 21 to 75 years were enrolled in the study according to criteria of International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM). We determined the efficacy of dapoxetine 30 mg/day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was intra vaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) measured by stopwatch. Safety and tolerability were assessed. All analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. The results showed that, dapoxetine significantly prolonged IELT (p<0.001) after 12 weeks. After treatment of 1st, 4th ,8th week mean IELT were 1.71 (SD±0.50) minutes, 2.36 (±0.46) minutes and 2.98 (±0.66) minutes respectively. At the end of 12th week 3.89 (±0.87) minutes was evaluated. Common adverse effects were observed as nausea (11.0%), diarrhoea (3.5%), headache (5.6%), dizziness (5.8%), insomnia (2.1%) and backache (1.8%). So from this study it could be said that, dapoxetine was an effective and generally well tolerated treatment for men with premature ejaculation.Bang J Psychiatry June 2017; 31(1): 15-19","year":" 2020-02-06 ","createdAt":"2020-10-04T11:10:54.307Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T11:10:54.307Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f994e7cf0a1204541cf1f55","title":"In vivo anti-diabetic&nbsp;effect of aqueous and methanolic macerated extracts of&nbsp;Atractylis gummifera","link":"https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJP/article/view/38870","abstract":"The anti-diabetic effect of Atractylis gummifera (plant used in traditional Moroccan medicine) has been evaluated in type 2 diabetic mice model.

The treatment of the mice was performed by daily gastric gavage for 5 weeks. The monitoring of the mice was carried out weekly by fasting glucose and measurement of biochemical parameters at the end of treatment. The aqueous macerate of A. gummifera was most effective that reduced the fasting blood glucose with 62.7%. In addition, this extract restored the biochemical parameters of diabetic mice to normal.Video Clip of Methodolpogy:5 min 53 sec:&nbsp; &nbsp;Click to watch","year":" 2019-04-14 ","createdAt":"2020-10-28T10:57:00.234Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-28T10:57:00.234Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f99518e6c6a708a68dc970b","title":"Management of Dengue in Children: An Update","link":"https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/DSHJ/article/view/49702","abstract":"Dengue viruses cause symptomatic infections or asymptomatic seroconversion. Symptomatic dengue infection is a systemic and dynamic disease. It has a wide clinical spectrum that includes both severe and non-severe clinical manifestations. Due to its dynamic nature, the severity of the disease will usually only be apparent around defervescence which often coincides with the onset of the critical phase. For a disease that is complex in its manifestations, management is relatively simple, inexpensive and very effective in saving lives, so long as correct and timely interventions are instituted. The main hemodynamic elements of dengue shock is hypovolemia with decreased vascular capacitance resulting from plasma leakage. Thus, the strategy of aggressive fluid resuscitation of septic shock is not applicable to severe dengue with plasma leakage. Volume replacement in children with dengue shock is a challenging management problem. Aggressive fluid resuscitation may indeed be harmful and should be limited to dengue shock with hypotension. There is a “narrow therapeutic index”; therefore, fluids have to be given timely, at the appropriate volume, rate, of the appropriate type (crystalloids, colloid and/or blood) and for the appropriate duration. Therein lies the challenge to physicians who are not familiar with the important practice of fluid titration through frequent and meticulous assessment. Progression of the disease through the critical phase should be tracked in hours of plasma leakage. Recognizing the cues to discontinue intravenous fluid therapy is just as important as knowing when to start it. Given time and hemodynamic stability, other issues such as thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy and raised liver enzymes will recover spontaneously or with supportive care.DS (Child) H J 2019; 35(2) : 162-178","year":" 2020-10-12 ","createdAt":"2020-10-28T11:10:06.637Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-28T11:10:06.637Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f9952346c6a708a68dc973f","title":"Modification in Structural, Morphological, Magnetic and Ferroelectric Properties of Calcium-Doped Bismuth Ferrite Nanoparticles","link":"https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/JES/article/view/49555","abstract":"The structural, morphological, magnetic and ferroelectric properties of calcium (Ca) doped bismuth ferrite (BFO) synthesized using a sol-gel method were studied.

This also led to the reduction in particle size by creating oxygen vacancies, which was observed from the surface morphology using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The Magnetic properties exhibited some enhancements in saturation magnetization when the particle size was near a limiting value. The reduction in the coercive magnetic field with the increase in dopant concentration was also evident from the M-H hysteresis loop measured by Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM). The Ferroelectric P-E hysteresis loop exhibited an increased symmetry in the hysteresis loop and increase in the polarization with the increase in %Ca. The 8% Ca doped BFO exhibited an incomplete saturation in the hysteresis loop and was evident to exhibit leakage current characteristics.Journal of Engineering Science 11(1), 2020, 123-131","year":" 2020-10-05 ","createdAt":"2020-10-28T11:12:52.330Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-28T11:12:52.330Z","__v":0}]

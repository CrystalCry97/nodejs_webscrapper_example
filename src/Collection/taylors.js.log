However, a large portion of the general populace is using these therapies in combination with allopathy lacking a proper understanding of possible interactions (synergistic or antagonistic) between the herbal product and the allopathic drug. This is based on the assumption that herbal drugs are relatively safe, i.e. without side effects. We have established a comprehensive understanding of the possible herb–drug interactions and identified interaction patterns between the most common herbs and drugs currently in use in the Indian market. For this purpose, we listed common interactors (herbs and allopathic drugs) using available scientific literature. Drugs were then categorized into therapeutic classes and aligned to produce a recognizable pattern present only if interactions were observed between a drug class and herb in the scientific literature. Interestingly, the top three categories (with highest interactors), antibiotics, oral hypoglycemics, and anticonvulsants, displayed synergistic interactions only. Another major interactor category was CYP450 enzymes, a natural component of our metabolism. Both activation and inhibition of CYP450 enzymes were observed. As many allopathic drugs are known CYP substrates, inhibitors or inducers, ingestion of an interacting herb could result in interaction with the co-administered drug. This information is largely unavailable for the Indian population and should be studied in greater detail to avoid such interactions. Although this information is not absolute, the systematic literature review proves the existence of herb–drug interactions in the literature and studies where no interaction was detected are equally important.","year":"","createdAt":"2020-09-13T08:46:43.324Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-13T08:46:43.324Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5ddc73bb9ce44d5cf1a6ea","title":"Herb-Drug Interactions and Confounding in Clinical Trials","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/J157v02n01_04","abstract":"Herb-drug interactions are being recognized for their potential to reduce the efficacy of, or cause additive side effects with, conventional medications.

In general, many pre-clinical and clinical pharmacokinetic HDIs have been reported. Our searches show that TCMs cause pharmacokinetic interactions with therapeutic drugs mainly by inhibiting or inducing drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. However, most of the interactions result from a small number of prescription medications and the actual potential for harm is low. Moreover, such HDIs can be avoided by discontinuing the TCMs. Despite the extensive number of reports on TCM-derived HDIs, the findings are frequently conflicting and can be confusing. The causes of the conflicts vary, but we classified them into three basic categories as follows: (1) complicated nature and poor quality control of TCMs, (2) different responses of various test systems to TCM exposure and (3) diverse study designs. Accordingly, we propose rational study designs for future HDI research. We also propose that a specific authoritative guide be established that provides recommendations for HDI studies.

Using in vitro, in silico, and in vivo approaches, many herbs and natural compounds isolated from herbs have been identified as substrates, inhibitors, and/or inducers of various CYP enzymes. For example, St. John's wort is a potent inducer of CYP3A4, which is mediated by activating the orphan pregnane X receptor. It also contains ingredients that inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Many other common medicinal herbs also exhibited inducing or inhibiting effects on the CYP system, with the latter being competitive, noncompetitive, or mechanism-based. It appears that the regulation of CYPs by herbal products is complex, depending on the herb type, their administration dose and route, the target organ and species. Due to the difficulties in identifying the active constituents responsible for the modulation of CYP enzymes, prediction of herb–drug metabolic interactions is difficult. However, herb–CYP interactions may have important clinical and toxicological consequences. For example, induction of CYP3A4 by St. John's wort may partly provide an explanation for the enhanced plasma clearance of a number of drugs, such as cyclosporine and innadivir, which are known substrates of CYP3A4, although other mechanisms including modulation of gastric absorption and drug transporters cannot be ruled out. In contrast, many organosulfur compounds, such as diallyl sulfide from garlic, are potent inhibitors of CYP2E1; this may provide an explanation for garlic's chemoproventive effects, as many mutagens require activation by CYP2E1. Therefore, known or potential herb–CYP interactions exist, and further studies on their clinical and toxicological roles are warranted. Given that increasing numbers of people are exposed to a number of herbal preparations that contain many constituents with potential of CYP modulation, high-throughput screening assays should be developed to explore herb–CYP interactions.","year":"2003","createdAt":"2020-09-13T08:46:53.203Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-13T08:46:53.203Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5ddc88bb9ce44d5cf1a6f9","title":"Highlights of drug - and herb- induced liver injury in the literature from 2016: how best to translate new information into clinical practice?","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17425255.2017.1362391","abstract":"Introduction: Over 1500 papers on drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and herb-induced liver injury (HILI) were published in 2016, many of which have the potential to impact clinical practice.Areas covered: Clinical studies and case series that lent themselves to new concepts in diagnosing, and treating DILI were selected for inclusion. Epidemiology of DILI in large prospective registries was highlighted. Causality assessment of drug hepatotoxicity remains challenging, as seen with cases of OxyELITE Pro (OEP).

Many recognized hepatotoxins are backed by a relatively few number of literature reports. Danan and Teschke make a strong case that an updated RUCAM should remain the gold standard for diagnosing DILI/HILI going forward, although the role of expert opinion is often still needed in cases where RUCAM falls short.

It is responsible for the systemic disposition of numerous structurally and pharmacologically unrelated lipophilic and amphipathic drugs, carcinogens, toxins, and other xenobiotics in many organs, such as the intestine, liver, kidney, and brain. Like cytochrome P450s (CYP3A4), Pgp is vulnerable to inhibition, activation, or induction by herbal constituents. This was demonstrated by using an ATPase assay, purified Pgp protein or intact Pgp‐expressing cells, and proper probe substrates and inhibitors. Curcumin, ginsenosides, piperine, some catechins from green tea, and silymarin from milk thistle were found to be inhibitors of Pgp, while some catechins from green tea increased Pgp‐mediated drug transport by heterotropic allosteric mechanism, and St. John's wort induced the intestinal expression of Pgp in vitro and in vivo. Some components (e.g., bergamottin and quercetin) from grapefruit juice were reported to modulate Pgp activity. Many of these herbal constituents, in particular flavonoids, were reported to modulate Pgp by directly interacting with the vicinal ATP‐binding site, the steroid‐binding site, or the substrate‐binding site. Some herbal constituents (e.g., hyperforin and kava) were shown to activate pregnane X receptor, an orphan nuclear receptor acting as a key regulator of MDR1 and many other genes. The inhibition of Pgp by herbal constituents may provide a novel approach for reversing multidrug resistance in tumor cells, whereas the stimulation of Pgp expression or activity has implication for chemoprotective enhancement by herbal medicines. Certain natural flavonols (e.g., kaempferol, quercetin, and galangin) are potent stimulators of the Pgp‐mediated efflux of 7,12‐dimethylbenz(a)‐anthracene (a carcinogen). The modulation of Pgp activity and expression by these herb constituents may result in altered absorption and bioavailability of drugs that are Pgp substrates. This is exemplified by increased oral bioavailability of phenytoin and rifampin by piperine and decreased bioavailability of indinavir, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, digoxin, and fexofenadine by coadministered St. John's wort. However, many of these drugs are also substrates of CYP3A4. Thus, the modulation of intestinal Pgp and CYP3A4 represents an important mechanism for many clinically important herb–drug interactions. Further studies are needed to explore the relative role of Pgp and CYP3A4 modulation by herbs and the mechanism for the interplay of these two important proteins in herb–drug interactions.","year":"2004","createdAt":"2020-09-13T08:47:04.548Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-13T08:47:04.548Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5ddc88bb9ce44d5cf1a6fc","title":"Warfarin and its interactions with foods, herbs and other dietary supplements","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1517/14740338.5.3.433","abstract":"Despite its complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, warfarin is still one of the most widely used oral anticoagulant agents.

Keywords included “herb,” “dietary supplement,” and cardiac terms. Case reports were excluded if they were herb combinations (some exceptions), Chinese herb mixtures, teas of mixed herb contents, mushrooms, poisonous plants, self-harm (e.g. suicide), excess dose (except vitamins/minerals), drugs or illegal drugs, drug-herbal interactions, and confounders of drugs or diseases. The spectrum of heart toxicities included hypertension, hypotension, hypokalemia, bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, heart attack, cardiac arrest, heart failure, and death. Results: Heart related problems were associated with approximately seven herbs: Four traditional Chinese medicine herbs – Don quai (Angelica sinensis), Jin bu huan (Lycopodium serratum), Thundergod vine or lei gong teng (Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F), and Ting kung teng (Erycibe henryi prain); one an Ayruvedic herb – Aswagandha, (Withania somnifera); and two North American herbs – blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides), and Yohimbe (Pausinystalia johimbe).

Expert opinion:  Herb–drug interactions, in general, and some interactions in particular (e.g., transporters, Phase II metabolism enzymes) are still poorly investigated and are difficult to evaluate because mixtures are administered with variable and often unspecified amounts of ingredients. Current evidence suggests that garlic and ginkgo can be safely co-administered, whereas CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., warfarin) should be monitored closely when ginseng therapy is started. Echinacea can induce drug metabolism mediated by CYP3A, but most likely relevant when administered with substances with a narrow therapeutic index or low oral bioavailability. The most relevant herbal perpetrator drug is SJW, which has substantial impact on CYP3A4- and CYP2C9-mediated metabolism and P-glycoprotein-mediated transport.

It can be concluded from these studies that polysaccharides derived from these products can play important roles in: (1) stimulating the growth of immune organs such as spleen, thymus and bursa; (2) increasing the number and activities of many interdependent cell types such as T, B lymphocytes, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells; (3) enhancing T-cell mediated immune response, such as an increased rate of T-lymphocyte transformation and proliferation; (4) enhancing humoral immune response, such as spleen and serum antibody production, the number of haemolytic plague forming cells (PFC) and haemolysin production and (5) inducing secretion and production of cytokines and complements of T-cells and NK cells.Today's poultry producers are confronted by numerous prophylactic techniques to prevent diseases.

The clearance rate decreased from 110.52 to 66.12 mLh−1 kg−1, the mean residence time extended from 63.1 to 164.54 h, the area under the plasma concentration–time curve increased from 86.58 to 152.93 µg h mL−1, the elimination half-life extended from 48.38 to 126.4 h, and the elimination rate constant decreased from 0.017 to 0.006 h, in the ZMYL combination group (p < 0.05). In terms of free Pt concentration, the apparent volume of distribution and clearance rate was statistically different (p < 0.05). The Pt plasma protein binding ratios in the early dose stages were significantly boosted by the co-administration of ZMYL (p < 0.01).Discussion and conclusion: ZMYL is a potential complementary and alternative medicine for cisplatin chemotherapy.

In the current study, the screening of α-glucosidase inhibitors from Coptidis-Rehmanniae herb couple which was composed of Rhizoma Coptidis and Radix Rehmanniae, was investigated by ultrafiltration liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UF-LC/MS). As a result, four compounds binding to α-glucosidase were observed and identified to be jatrorrhizine, coptisine, palmatine, and berberine. Subsequently, the sustained off-resonance irradiation collision-induced dissociation Fourier transform mass spectrometry was performed for validation.

Adverse reactions associated with concomitant NHP-therapeutic use may result from competing interactions at the level of the key xenobiotic-biotransforming phase I enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) or the membrane-bound ATP-dependent protein pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In this study, selected NHPs of interest to the HIV+ community were assessed for their ability to affect these two important mechanisms of drug disposition. Briefly, commercial-source teas and powdered extracts in capsule formulations were examined for their ability to inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of the coadministered reference substrate dibenzyl-fluorescein, and their ability to stimulate P-gp ATPase activity. Among the herbal capsules, it was found that aqueous extracts of two different goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis. L.) products were the most inhibitory of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism among all NHPs tested (IC50: 3.03 and 3.23 mg/mL). Goldenseal and milk thistle [Silybum marianum. (L.) Gaertn.] teas were found to stimulate P-gp ATPase to a greater degree than the reference positive control verapamil (20 μ M). As well, 70% ethanol extracts of one goldenseal product (designated NRP 121) and aqueous extracts of another (designated NRP 17) had the highest relative P-gp ATPase activity overall. Milk thistle and goldenseal products were further analyzed for levels of their marker constituents by HPLC; silibinin and berberine in the experimental design were found to be at biologically relevant concentrations. High-throughput in vitro. studies such as the CYP3A4 inhibition and P-pg ATPase screening assays may help to determine which NHPs interact with drug disposition mechanisms, thus ensuring that the occurrence of adverse events due to competing interactions is minimized. They are useful for selecting specific NHPs, NHP formulations, phytochemicals, or drugs to be advanced to more detailed in vivo. experimental designs.

To evaluate an algorithmic approach involving a multidisciplinary team for causality assessment of suspected herb-induced liver injury (HILI) cases and to compare the causality score using this multidisciplinary approach and Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM). Methods. A team consisting of hepatologist, clinical toxicologist, analytical toxicologist, and Chinese medicine (CM) pharmacist was formed to do causality assessment based on a protocol for suspected HILI cases. The likelihood of the diagnosis of individual case was first assessed systematically by a hepatologist and clinical toxicologist independently after collecting information about four aspects: (1) clinical course, (2) exclusion of alternative causes, (3) quality of the prescription and herbal product by examining the CM prescriptions and analysis of biological and herb samples, (4) scientific support on comprehensive literature review on English and Chinese medical database, and subsequently concluded in a consensus meeting held by the multidisciplinary team. The final causality score of each patient was compared with the likelihood of causality as assessed by RUCAM. Results. Between 2005 and 2007, 48 consecutive patients with suspected HILI were enrolled and 21 patients were excluded due to the establishment of an alternative cause of liver impairment or the lack of any information on the herbs taken. Twenty-seven patients were recruited, among them 15 consumed Chinese herbal medicines, 10 used proprietary Chinese medicinal products, and 2 used both. The concordance between the causality assessment of the hepatologist and clinical toxicologist was moderate (weighted κ = 0.48, 95%CI 0.30–0.66).

The results revealed that the most commonly used herbs by diabetic patients in Jordan were Trigonella foenumgraecum (22.9%), Lupinus albus (14.6%), Alliumm sativum (11.5%), Allium cepa (5.2%), Nigella sativa (7.3%), Zea mays L. (6.3%), Urtica dioica L. (8.3%), Eucalyptus globules LA (9.4%), Olea europea L. (3.1%), Cumminum cyminum (9.4%), Coriandrum sativum (10.4%), Salvia officinalis L. (3.1%), and Tilia cordata (1%). Furthermore, it is found that 47.9% of the patients used herbs according to advice from their friends on a daily basis. The side effects were reported by 36.5% of the patients and include headache, nausea, dizziness, itching, palpitation, and sweating. Among the patients, 72.9% used the herbs as adjunctive therapy along with their anti-diabetic drugs and 80.2% of the patients informed their physicians about their use. A 79.2% of the sample confirmed their intention to re-use these herbs as 86.5% of them were satisfied with their diabetes control. There was a significant relationship between the use of herbs, the patient’s place of residence and his/her level of education. The main conclusion of this survey is that the use of medicinal herbs among diabetic patient in Jordan is common. Therefore, it is essential to increase the level of awareness among diabetic patients and health care providers regarding the efficacy and toxicity of these medicinal herbs.","year":"2006","createdAt":"2020-09-13T08:48:10.337Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-13T08:48:10.337Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5ddccabb9ce44d5cf1a71d","title":"Phylogenetic analysis and characterization of the complete chloroplast genome of Dipsacus asperoides, the endemic medicinal herb in China","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23802359.2019.1640648","abstract":"Dipsacus asperoides is a traditional and endemic medicinal herb in China.

Although viral infections prevail, antibiotics are commonly prescribed. In this study, the efficacy and tolerability of EPs 7630 tablets, a herbal drug preparation from the roots of Pelargonium sidoides, were investigated in adults with acute bronchitis outside the strict indication for antibiotics.Research design and methods:In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre dose-finding trial using an adaptive group-sequential design, 406 patients were randomly assigned to one of four parallel treatment groups (10 mg EPs 7630 tablets three times a day (30-mg group), 20 mg EPs 7630 tablets three times a day (60-mg group), 30 mg EPs 7630 tablets three times a day (90-mg group) or placebo three times a day) for a treatment period of 7 days. Primary endpoint was the change in the total score of bronchitis-specific symptoms (BSS) from baseline to day 7.Results:Between day 0 and day 7, the mean BSS score decreased by 2.7 ± 2.3 (placebo), 4.3 ± 1.9 (30-mg group), 6.1 ± 2.1 (60-mg group), and 6.3 ± 2.0 points (90-mg group), respectively.

Therefore, drug-drug interactions can result in changes in pharmacological or toxicological response following concomitant administration of many therapeutic agents. It has become evident that two factors i.e. drug efflux pump- P-glycoprotein (MDR gene product) and metabolizing enzyme- CYP3A4 play major roles in this process. These two key proteins regulate all pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions through the process of drug absorption, metabolism, disposition and elimination. Co-administration of two or more drugs can affect these processes due to altered functions of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A4 and consequently change clinical response and final outcome. After co-administration, some drugs may induce the activity of P-gp and/or CYP3A4 resulting in subtherapeutic blood levels and therapeutic failure due to reduced absorption and/or increased metabolism. Conversely, inhibition(s) of P-gp and/or CYP3A4 can cause enhanced plasma concentration and therefore, drug toxicity. Overlapping substrate specificities to these proteins make it difficult to understand perplexing pharmacokinetic interactions with multidrug regimens. Inter-patient variability of drug response can occur due to change in genetic profiles, intake of food, herbal supplement, and recreational drugs. In this review, we have outlined several clinically important CYP and MDR-mediated drug-drug interactions of antiretroviral agents, antineoplastic agents, azole antifungals, statins, methadone, antibacterials, cardiovascular medicines, immune modulators, recreational drugs and herbal agents. Mechanisms by which such drug interactions occur have been briefly discussed in some of the examples.","year":"2006","createdAt":"2020-09-13T08:48:25.049Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-13T08:48:25.049Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5ddcd9bb9ce44d5cf1a722","title":"Risk Management Education in Southwest Medicinal Herb Production and Marketing in New Mexico: Assessing Grower and Potential Grower Outcomes after a Two-Day Workshop","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10496475.2013.819477","abstract":" A risk management educational program to help small-scale farmers of native medicinal herbs of the U.S. Southwest (SWH) was conducted.

These reactions comprise approximately 17% of all hepatic adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and they may be severe. Causes of ‘pure’ (bland) cholestasis include oestrogens and anabolic steroids; rarer associations are with antimicrobials and NSAIDs. ‘Cholestatic hepatitis’ is a common drug reaction in which liver injury and inflammation cause significant elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as well as cholestasis. Chlorpromazine and ketoconazole are classic examples, but it is now exemplified by amoxycillin-clavulanate and other oxy-penicillins. Chronic cholestasis results from small bile duct injury leading to the vanishing bile duct syndrome (VBDS), a disorder mimicking primary biliary cirrhosis, or from injury to larger bile ducts causing secondary sclerosing cholangitis. Whilst there is increasing evidence of a genetic predisposition to cholestatic drug reactions, there are currently no pretreatment tests to predict drug safety. Prevention of severe reactions therefore relies on early detection of liver injury and prompt drug withdrawal. Symptomatic management includes relief of pruritus and correction of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency. In small cohort studies, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) arrested progressive cholestasis in two-thirds of cases, but evidence for use of corticosteroids is anecdotal. This review considers diagnosis, pathogenesis, prevention and management of drug-induced cholestasis, with particular reference to frequently- and newly-described causes.","year":"2003","createdAt":"2020-09-13T08:48:25.049Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-13T08:48:25.049Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f5ddcd9bb9ce44d5cf1a726","title":"Herb Use Among Health Care Professionals Enrolled in an Online Curriculum on Herbs and Dietary Supplements","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/J157v06n02_05","abstract":"Background: Although many adults in the United States use herbs, little is known about the personal use of herbs by health care professionals (HCPs) and factors associated with use.Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of HCPs prior to their enrollment in an online course about herbs and dietary supplements between September 2004 and May 2005.

Preclinical studies of high doses/concentrations of GLEs of varying quality and standardization hinted at both an inhibition and induction of metabolic enzymes and transporters. However, in humans, positive in vitro-findings could not be replicated in vivo. At maximum recommended doses of 240 mg/day, a clinically relevant interaction potential of the standardized GLE EGb 761 could not be shown. GLE doses higher than the recommended ones led to a weak induction of the CYP2C19-mediated omeprazole 5-hydroxylation, and a weak inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated midazolam 1′-hydroxylation, respectively. Also, the regular intake of a poorly characterized GLE at a dose of 360 mg/day slightly increased the bioavailability of talinolol, a substrate of P-glycoprotein and various organic anion-transporting polypeptides.

To further investigate the related mechanism, everted intestinal sac model in vitro was used to indicate that alteration of in vivo pharmacokinetics of five alkaloids could be attributed to, at least in part, the absorption changes by coadministration of other herbs. These discoveries served as a theoretical basis for clinical use of Shuanghua Baihe tables.","year":"2018","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:28:39.903Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:28:39.903Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67752730491a661faa3fab","title":"Miltefosine, an FDA-approved drug for the ‘orphan disease’, leishmaniasis","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1517/21678707.2015.1039510","abstract":"Introduction: Leishmaniasis, and most tropical diseases, are rare/orphan diseases in the developed world but not rare worldwide.

In this review, we discuss the evolution of both MS technology and its applications over the past 50 years to meet the increasing demand of drug metabolism studies. These advances include ionization sources, mass analyzers, a wide range of MS acquisition strategies and data mining tools that have substantially accelerated the metabolite identification process and changed the overall drug metabolism landscape. Exemplary applications for characterization and identification of both small-molecule xenobiotics and biological macromolecules are described.

To decipher the action mechanisms of RRL from a systematic perspective, a systems pharmacology approach integrated absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) system, drug targeting, and network analysis was introduced. First, by the ADME screening system and the target fishing process, 56 potential active compounds and 62 targets were obtained, respectively. In addition, compound-target network demonstrated that most compounds interacted with multiple targets, indicating that RRL may enhance its therapeutic effects probably through hitting on multiple targets in a holistic level. Moreover, target-pathway network and gene ontology analysis showed that multiple targets of RRL were involved in several biological pathways, i.e. Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, and VEGF signaling pathway, which dissecting the therapeutic effects of RRL on various diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, depression, adaptation diseases, etc. In summary, this work successfully explains the potential active compounds and the multi-scale curative action mechanisms of RRL for treating various diseases; meanwhile, it implies that RRL could be applied as a novel therapeutic agent in arthritic diseases.

Antimicrobial potential of decoctions (extracts prepared by boiling plant material in a given solvent), used in ethnomedicine preferentially to the pure essential oil, was also investigated.Materials and methods: The essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation was screened for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods. Effects of the oil on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus cells were investigated using turbidimetric measurements and visualized using scanning electron microscopy. Analyses of the chemical composition of the oils were done using gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.Results and discussion: Both the essential oil and the decocts exhibited a very high antimicrobial activity against all tested strains, with S. aureus as the most sensitive one [e.g., for the oil sample the values for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were 0.02, 0.04 µL/mL, respectively]. Growth curves of S. aureus demonstrated a significant decrease in turbidity (for the MIC concentration this amounted to ca. 70%) showing a concentration-dependent lysis of the cells, confirmed by scanning electron microscopy.

Data from the 2002 US National Health Interview Survey, including the supplement on CAM, were analyzed using SAS. Cross-tabulation and logistical regression were used to determine the association between herb use and race/ethnicity, while adjusting for demographic factors.  Results. After adjusting for age, gender and educational attainment, we found that APIs were more likely to use herbs than non-Hispanic Whites (OR=1.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.5; p=0.013), with the difference being most prominent in those 60 years old or older (OR=2.9; 95% CI: 1.8, 4.5; p<0.0001).

Data collection included the demographics of callers, types of exposures, substances involved, amounts ingested and severity.Results: Of the 918 HR and DS calls received, 259 (28.2%) were drug information queries, 599 (65.3%) were exposures, and 60 (6.5%) were excluded. Exposures occurred most often in pediatric patients 324 (54.1%), but exposures resulting in ADRs occurred most often in adults at recommended doses. There were 233 ADRs, of which 67 (28.8%) occurred in children. The most common products involved in ADRs were zinc (38.2%), echinacea (7.7%), chromium picolinate (6.4%) and witch hazel (6%).

Objective: In the present paper, we report and discuss the recognition and management of moderate to severe idiosyncratic drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Methods: A bibliographic search was performed on the PubMed database of the US National Library of Medicine for articles published from January 1990 to November 2008. Results/conclusions: Moderate to severe idiosyncratic drug-induced thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 × 109/l) is a relatively rare and potentially serious disorder. The origin may be myelosuppression or peripheral, owing to either the consumption of platelets or their immune-mediated destruction. The most common molecules responsible are heparins, quinidine, sulfonamides and gold salts. Clinically, the most classical symptom is a typical pattern of bleeding of variable intensity depending on the severity of thrombocytopenia and the molecule involved. Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia induced by heparin (type II) is more often associated with thrombotic events. The diagnosis is based on medical history and a set of clinical criteria, which also specify the level of imputability. Although the role of serological tests is not well established, they seem particularly valuable in some situations in which differential diagnosis is difficult or in type II heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The treatment includes discontinuation of the suspected drug, and symptomatic measures that depend on the severity of clinical symptoms.","year":"2009","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:29:07.195Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:29:07.195Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67754330491a661faa3fc1","title":"Verbena officinalis a herb with promising broad spectrum antimicrobial potential","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23312009.2017.1363342","abstract":"The treatment of infectious diseases has increasingly become a serious problem as the pathogens are rapidly acquiring resistance against the current antibiotics.

Even though adverse health effects of many herbal dietary supplements have been reported, safety assurances are not being addressed adequately. Toxicological data on the identification of genotoxic and tumorigenic ingredients in many raw herbs are also lacking. Currently, more than 30 herbal dietary supplements and active ingredients have been selected by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) for toxicity and tumorigenicity studies. Due to the complexity of the chemical components present in plant extracts, there are no established methodologies for determining the mechanisms of toxicity (particularly tumorigenicity) induced by herbs, such as Gingko biloba leaf extract (GBE) and other herbal plant extracts. Consequently, the understanding of toxicity of herbal dietary supplements remains limited. We have proposed that application of DNA microarrays could be a highly practical initial approach for revealing biological pathways and networks associated with toxicity induced by herbal dietary supplements and the generation of hypotheses to address likely mechanisms. The changes in expression of subsets of genes of interest, such as the modulation of drug metabolizing genes, can be analyzed after treatment with an herbal dietary supplement. Although levels of gene expression do not represent fully the levels of protein activities, we propose that subsequent biochemical and genomic experiments based on these initial observations will enable elucidation of the mechanisms leading to toxicity, including tumorigenicity. This review summarizes the current practices of microarray analysis of gene expressions in animals treated with herbal dietary supplements and discusses perspectives for the proposed strategy.

Recently, pharmaceutical scientists have shifted their focus to designing a drug delivery system for herbal medicines using a scientific approach. For a long time herbal medicines were not considered for development as novel formulations owing to lack of scientific justification and processing difficulties, such as standardization, extraction and identification of individual drug components in complex polyherbal systems. However, modern phytopharmaceutical research solves the scientific needs for herbal medicines as in modern medicine, which gives way for developing novel formulations such as nanoparticles, microemulsions, matrix systems, solid dispersions, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and so on.

Adverse drug reactions are a possible consequence of DDIs and health operators are often unaware of the clinical risks of certain drug combinations. Many papers on drug interactions have been published in recent years, but most of them focused on potential DDIs while few studies have been conducted on actual interactions.  Areas covered:  This paper reviews the epidemiology of actual DDIs in outpatients as well as in hospital settings and in spontaneous reporting databases. The incidence of actual DDIs is consistently lower than that of potential DDIs. However, the absolute number of patients involved is high, representing a significant proportion of adverse drug reactions. The importance of risk factors such as age, polypharmacy and genetic polymorphisms is also evaluated. The relevance and efficacy of tools for recognizing and preventing DDIs are discussed.  Expert opinion:  Potential DDIs far outnumber actual drug interactions. The potential for an adverse interaction to occur is often theoretical, and clinically important adverse effects occur only in the presence of specific risk factors. Several studies have shown the efficacy of computers in early detection of DDIs. However, a correct risk–benefit evaluation by the prescribing physician, together with a careful clinical, physiological and biochemical monitoring of patients, is essential. Future directions of drug interaction research include the increasing importance of pharmacogenetics in preventing DDIs and the evaluation of interactions with biological drugs.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:29:24.116Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:29:24.116Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67755430491a661faa3fcf","title":"An analysis of Vietnamese traditional herbal medicines for prescription and non-prescription drugs, herbicides and pesticides","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00450618.2017.1296187","abstract":"The aim of this research was to determine whether pharmaceutical adulterants and/or pesticides/herbicides were present in Vietnamese traditional herbal medicines.

The controlled disruption and ablation of the stratum corneum (SC), the predominant barrier for drug delivery, is achieved by the use of lasers. The possible mechanisms of laser-assisted drug permeation are the direct ablation of the skin barrier, optical breakdown by a photomechanical wave and a photothermal effect. It has been demonstrated that ablative approaches for enhancing drug transport provide some advantages, including increased bioavailability, fast treatment time, quick recovery of SC integrity and the fact that skin surface contact is not needed. In recent years, the concept of using laser techniques to treat the skin has attracted increasing attention.  Areas covered:  This review describes recent developments in using nonablative and ablative lasers for drug absorption enhancement. This review systematically introduces the concepts and enhancement mechanisms of lasers, highlighting the potential of this technique for greatly increasing drug absorption via the skin. Lasers with different wavelengths and types are employed to increase drug permeation. These include the ruby laser, the erbium:yttrium-gallium-garnet laser, the neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser and the CO2 laser. Fractional modality is a novel concept for promoting topical/transdermal drug delivery. The laser is useful in enhancing the permeation of a wide variety of permeants, such as small-molecule drugs, macromolecules and nanoparticles.  Expert opinion:  This potential use of the laser affords a new treatment for topical/transdermal application with significant efficacy. Further studies using a large group of humans or patients are needed to confirm and clarify the findings in animal studies. Although the laser fluence or output energy used for enhancing drug absorption is much lower than for treatment of skin disorders and rejuvenation, the safety of using lasers is still an issue. Caution should be used in optimizing the feasible conditions of the lasers in balancing the effectiveness of permeation enhancement and skin damage.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:29:40.697Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:29:40.697Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67756430491a661faa3fd8","title":"Hepatoprotective potential of Cassia auriculata roots on ethanol and antitubercular drug-induced hepatotoxicity in experimental models","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/13880209.2013.837075","abstract":"Context: Tarvada [Cassia auriculata Linn.

The conventional approach for the discovery and development of antidiabetic drug products from natural products involving a high-throughput, bioactivity guided drug screening of single compounds obtained from thousands of herbs has proven to be a costly and non-productive effort. Hence, an alternative way of developing new drug candidates, as suggested in this review, is to reduce and simplify a well-established combination herbal formula, along with the pharmacologic evaluation of a small group of phytochemic compounds, which are therapeutically effective as the original formula and have known chemical structures, compositions and mechanisms of action that are similar to chemical drugs.","year":"2007","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:29:51.955Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:29:51.955Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67756f30491a661faa3fe2","title":"Pharmacokinetic interactions between herbal remedies and medicinal drugs","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00498250210124147","abstract":"1. The use of herbal products to treat a wide range of conditions is rising rapidly, leading to increased intake of phytochemicals. Recent studies revealed potentially fatal interactions between herbal remedies and traditional drugs. 2. In transplant patients, self-medication with St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) has led to a drop in plasma levels of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine, causing tissue rejection. 3. Intake of St John's wort increases the expression of intestinal P-glycoprotein and the expression of CYP3A4 in the liver and intestine. The combined up-regulation in intestinal P-glycoprotein and hepatic and intestinal CYP3A4 impairs the absorption and stimulates the metabolism of cyclosporine, leading to subtherapeutic plasma levels. The St John's wort component, hyperforin, contributes to the induction of CYP3A4. 4. St John's wort also enhances the metabolism of other CYP3A4 substrates including the protease inhibitors indinavir and nevirapine, oral contraceptives, and tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline. 5. Other herbal remedies with the potential to modulate cytochrome P450 activity and thus participate in interactions with conventional drugs include Milk thistle, Angelica dahurica, ginseng, garlic preparations, Danshen and liquorice. 6. Herbal products are currently not subject to the rigorous testing indispensable for conventional drugs. However, if potential drug interactions are to be predicted, it is essential that the ability of herbal products to interfere with drug-metabolizing enzyme systems is fully established.","year":"2002","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:29:51.955Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:29:51.955Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67756f30491a661faa3fe3","title":"Comparative efficacy of herbal and allopathy drugs against coccidiosis in poultry","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4081/ijas.2011.e3","abstract":"For this study, 240 one-day-old broiler chicken were used to test the anti-coccidial efficacy of a herbal drug Coxigon® compared with a chemical synthetic Diclazuril® against Coccidiosis in broilers.

With such physicochemical properties, the oral bioavailability of these compounds lacks dose proportionality, is very limited and extremely erratic. Different lipid-based formulations have been explored in the past few decades to improve the oral delivery of such compounds. In recent years, the most popular approach is their incorporation into self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS), with particular emphasis on self-nano-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS).Areas covered: This review offers an updated overview of SNEDDS application from the biopharmaceutical point of view. The focus of this review deals with the potential of SNEDDS utilization to overcome absorption barriers following oral administration of lipophilic drugs. This includes a comprehensive description of the primary mechanisms by which lipids and lipophilic excipients, used to formulate SNEDDS, could affect drug absorption, bioavailability and disposition following oral administration.Expert opinion: The utilization of SNEDDS to augment the oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs goes beyond improvement in drug’s solubility, as was initially presumed. In fact, SNEDDS have a potential to increase oral bioavailability by multi-concerted mechanisms such as reduced intra-enterocyte metabolism by CYP P450 enzymes, reduced P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux activity and hepatic first-pass metabolism bypass via lymphatic absorption. This unique biopharmaceutical point of view, presented in this review, contributes to the understanding of proper drug candidate selection and of the approach in SNEDDS formulation design.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:29:51.955Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:29:51.955Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67756f30491a661faa3fe7","title":"Preparation of an ionic liquid-functionalized polymer monolith and its application in the separation of Chinese herb with HPLC","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10826076.2016.1204552","abstract":"A porous functionalized monolithic material based on ionic liquids (ILs) was produced through in situ polymerization within the confines of a stainless steel column (50&nbsp;×&nbsp;4.6&nbsp;mm i.d.).

But despite the fact that numerous prescription and OTC pharmaceuticals are also natural products, herbal medicines are defined by U.S. regulatory authorities as dietary supplements and are, in fact, strictly prohibited from promotion as agents to treat, diagnose, or prevent disease. In this review, the argument is made that herbal supplements are indeed drugs, by strict pharmacological definition. However, this regulatory double standard has led to misconceptions among the public and the health care professions alike regarding the safety and efficacy of botanical agents. In cases where herbal remedies are demonstrated effective by double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials, it should logically be appreciated that these agents also pose a risk of toxicity either when taken alone or in combination with prescription or OTC drugs. The most obvious drug-herb interactions are those that can be predicted as additive, dose-dependent extension of the biochemical actions of the offending agents. Less appreciated, but gaining considerable notoriety, are those adverse reactions that cannot be predicted a priori due to pharmacokinetic interactions at the level of altered absorption, metabolism, distribution, and/or excretion. The challenge in pharmaceutical care, particularly where the practitioner may be empathetic with a patient's desire to use herbal remedies, is to identify a mechanism by which unpredictable side effects and interactions can be evaluated for each specific herbal formulation. Until regulatory legislation dictates that this responsibility lies with herbal manufacturers, the prospective and retrospective studies on herb-drug interactions are left to academic and federal/state researchers and clinicians. In proposing that phytomedicinals be subjected to limited efficacy testing and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic evaluation, the author also cautions that these studies be performed fairly and objectively, in the absence of the blind advocacy or intentional negative bias that characterizes the polarity of stakeholder viewpoints in this health care debate.","year":"2001","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:00.645Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:00.645Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67757830491a661faa3fec","title":"Evaluation of herbal antimalarial MAMA decoction-amodiaquine combination in murine malaria model","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/13880209.2016.1155626","abstract":"Context: Co-administration of amodiaquine with MAMA decoction (MD), an herbal antimalarial drug comprising the leaves of Mangifera indica L.

Many literature works presenting important aspects related to stereochemistry of drug metabolism are available. However, there is very little literature on stereoselectivity of chiral drug transport and enantiomer–transporter interaction. In recent years, the experimental research within this field showed good momentum. Herein, an up-to-date review on this topic was presented. Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), Multidrug Resistance Proteins (MRP), P-glycoprotein (P-gp), Organic Anion Transporters (OATs), Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides (OATPs), Organic Cation Transporters (OCTs), Peptide Transport Proteins (PepTs), Human Proton-Coupled Folate Transporter (PCFT) and Multidrug and Toxic Extrusion Proteins (MATEs), have been reported to exhibit either positive or negative enantio-selective substrate recognition. The approaches utilized to study chirality in enantiomer–transporter interaction include inhibition experiments of specific transporters in cell models (e.g. Caco-2 cells), transport study using drug resistance cell lines or transgenic cell lines expressing transporters in wild type or variant, the use of transporter knockout mice, pharmacokinetics association of single nucleotide polymorphism in transporters, pharmacokinetic interaction study of racemate in the presence of specific transporter inhibitor or inducer, molecule cellular membrane affinity chromatography and pharmacophore modeling. Enantiomer–enantiomer interactions exist in chiral transport. The strength and/or enantiomeric preference of stereoselectivity may be species or tissue-specific, concentration-dependent and transporter family member-dependent. Modulation of specific drug transporter by pure enantiomers might exhibit opposite stereoselectivity. Further studies with integrated approaches will open up new horizons in stereochemistry of pharmacokinetics.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:11.279Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:11.279Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67758330491a661faa3ff5","title":"Assessment of chemically characterized Salvia sclarea L. essential oil and its combination with linalyl acetate as novel plant based antifungal, antiaflatoxigenic and antioxidant agent against herbal drugs contamination and probable mode of action","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786419.2019.1593168","abstract":"The present investigation reports antifungal and antiaflatoxigenic efficacy of Salvia sclarea essential oil (SSEO) and its combination with Linalyl acetate (LA) (1:1) against herbal drug deteriorating molds and aflatoxin B1 contamination.

Work of the MSKCC Center for the Study of Botanical Immunomodulators is described, and guidelines for cancer patients’ use of dietary supplements outlined. Herbs and other botanicals are complex, physiologically active agents, but little is known about most of the popular, widely available dietary supplements. Herb–drug interactions, a major concern, are exacerbated in the cancer setting. Biologically active agents may interfere with chemotherapy and other prescription medications. They may exert anticoagulant activity at rather inconvenient times such as during surgery, and create other serious problems. Research on the bioavailability, effective dosage, safety, and benefits of these complex agents is sorely needed.

Almost 38 percent of school districts currently implement student drug testing, and more schools may be considering implementation due to emerging recreational drug use laws. Parents are an essential key stakeholder and decision-maker in school policies. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine Colorado parents’ perceptions regarding high school drug testing. Methods: A cross-sectional research design was used to assess parental support for implementing drug testing in public high schools. A total of 205 participants completed a survey evaluating support, attitude, and beliefs regarding this policy. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the data. Results: The majority of parents perceived that alcohol (68.3%), cannabis (77.6%), and illicit drugs (51.2%) were a problem amongst students at their child’s high school. Parents overall were supportive of drug testing students (61.9%), except for parents who were current cannabis users (p = .002). The majority of parents are supportive of drug testing because they believe it could help students resist peer pressure (65.9%), facilitate early intervention (e.g. counseling; 71.2%), while not violating student privacy rights (57.6%) or creating a negative school climate (50.7%). Conclusions/Importance: Parents recognize there may be an adolescent drug use problem. Parental support of drug testing is an important consideration for superintendents/school districts who are contemplating implementation of a drug testing policy for high schools.

However, there is no clear evidence of the mechanism of action or a molecular target of C. nutans. In this study, the extracellular activity of C. nutans extracts against HSV-2 infected on HEp-2 cells was investigated in terms of its molecular aspects. HSV-2 was treated with the extracts and adsorped into the HEp-2 cells. After infection, HSV-2 DNA quantities in the infected cells were assessed and compared by the quantitative dot blot hybridisation technique. The results showed that treating the viruses with either less or more highly purified extracts before infection resulted in great reductions of viral infectivity. Further investigation was performed by Western blot analysis to determine the activities of the extracts on the viral proteins. At least eight viral proteins of the infected cell proteins (ICP) and some structural proteins, including 146, 125, 78, 69, 55, 44, 40 and 20 KDa proteins, were depleted and reduced gradually with higher and lower concentrated herb extracts, respectively.

Sativex is the first licensed phytocannabinoid-based drug approved, or in the process of approval, as therapy for indications such as MS-associated spasticity or chronic pain. Sativex contains a combination of two cannabinoids in approximately equal quantities (δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol) and is administered via an oromucosal pump spray, aiming at minimising psychotropic side effects and first pass effect. Pivotal clinical safety and efficacy data that led to Sativex's approval are discussed, as well as issues that have arisen with its clinical usage.

Recently, herbal PAK1 inhibitors have gained immense interest over synthetic ones mainly due to their non-toxic effects. Till date, many herbal compounds have been suggested to inhibit PAK1, but their information on selectivity, bioavailability, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties, and molecular interactions with PAK1 has not been explored. Hence, this study was designed with computational approaches to explore and identify the best herbal PAK1-blockers showing good ADMET properties, druggable features and binding affinity with PAK1. Herbal inhibitors reported here were initially filtered with Lipinski’s rule of five (RO5). Then, molecular docking between these inhibitors and PAK1 catalytic sites was performed using AutoDock Vina and GOLD suite to determine the binding affinity and interactions. Finally, 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on three top-ranked inhibitors including cucurbitacin I (C-I), nymphaeol A (NA), and staurosporine (SPN) were carried out. The binding free energies and interactions revealed that NA can strongly bind with the PAK1 catalytic cleft. PASS prediction and ADMET profiling supported that NA is appeared to be a more selective and safer inhibitor than C-I and SPN. These results conform to the previous experimental evidences, and therefore, NA from Okinawa propolis could be a promising inhibitor for treating PAK1-dependent illnesses.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

It is now generally accepted that the gut microbiota plays an important role in drug metabolism during enterohepatic circulation either before drug absorption or through various microbial enzymatic reactions in the gut. In addition, some drugs are metabolized by the intestinal microbiota to specific metabolites that cannot be formed in the liver. More importantly, metabolizing drugs through the gut microbiota prior to absorption can alter the systemic bioavailability of certain drugs. Therefore, understanding intestinal flora-mediated drug metabolism is critical to interpreting changes in drug pharmacokinetics. Here, we summarize the effects of gut microbiota on drug pharmacokinetics, and propose that the influence of intestinal flora on pharmacokinetics should be organically related to the therapeutic effects and side effects of drugs. More importantly, we could rationally perform the strategy of intestinal microflora-mediated metabolism to design drugs.","year":"2018","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:42.271Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:42.271Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6775a230491a661faa4009","title":"Drug interactions","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10837450902891550","abstract":"Drugs for allergy are often taken in combination with other drugs, either to treat allergy or other conditions.

Several cytochrome P450 enzymes are expressed in placental trophoblast at different stages of pregnancy, though only a few of these have functional activity to metabolize xenobiotics. Drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein/MDR1 or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are highly expressed in the placenta, and their functional activities have been demonstrated in the placenta both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, several studies have reported on ligand-activated transcription factors and nuclear receptors referred to as “xenosensors” in the placenta. The xenosensors control transcriptional regulation of both xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters in different organs. Their ligands include toxic compounds and environmental pollutants, drugs, as well as herbal, dietary or vitamin supplements. Nevertheless, it remains debatable whether the placental barrier adapts to toxic injuries coming either from maternal medication or environmental contamination and whether the placenta contains a mechanism to respond dynamically in protecting the developing fetus. In the present paper, we summarize current knowledge about the activity and expression of major ligand-activated transcriptional mechanisms involved in biotransformation enzymes and transporters regulation in human placenta. In particular, we highlight the emerging roles of aryl hydrocarbon (AHR), vitamin D (VDR), glucocorticoid (GR) and pregnane X (PXR) receptors in that regulation. We show that the placenta constitute a unique metabolizing organ with significant overlap of exogenous and endogenous compounds metabolism controlled by nuclear receptors.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:42.271Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:42.271Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6775a230491a661faa400c","title":"Herbal medicines: challenges in the modern world.

Additional discussion points comprise safety and adulteration issues associated with HMs, including regulatory changes and new legislative measures undertaken by the authorities. Materials available from legislative and governmental websites, PubMed and news media were used.Expert commentary: Due to cultural diversities in the EU and Russia, traditional HMs of other regions, particularly Chinese Traditional and Ayurvedic medicines, are also popular. Recently, dietary supplements containing multiple herbal and other natural products have flooded the EU and Russian markets. Pharmacovigilance in these markets is challenging in terms of establishing quality and safety of ingredients, determining efficacy, and defining risks of herb-herb and herb-drug interactions.

Areas covered:  The author presents an overview of the historical development and basic principles of theory and practice of Chinese herbal medicine, its materia medica and prescription formulas, and discusses the motivation for and rationale of its application to drug discovery. Furthermore, the author distinguishes the five main approaches to drug discovery from Chinese herbal medicine, based on the decreasing amount and detail of historical and clinical Chinese medicine knowledge that informed the research effort.  Expert opinion:  Many compounds that have been isolated from the Chinese materia medica exhibit pharmacological activities comparable to pharmaceutical drugs. With the exception of the antimalarial drug artemisinin, however, this knowledge has not led to the successful development of new drugs outside of China. The chance of success in a Chinese medicine–based drug discovery effort will be increased by consideration of the empirical knowledge that has been documented over many centuries in the historical materia medica and prescription literature. Most Chinese medicine–derived compounds affect more than one target and do not correspond to the one compound/one-target drug discovery paradigm. A new frontier is opening up with the development of drugs consisting of combinations of multiple compounds acting on multiple targets under the paradigm of network pharmacology. The ancient practice of combining multiple drugs in prescription formulas can serve as inspirational analogy and a practical guide.","year":"2013","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:42.271Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:42.271Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6775a230491a661faa400f","title":"Testing of the estrogenic activity and toxicity of Stephania venosa herb in ovariectomized rats","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15376516.2012.668573","abstract":"Stephania venosa Spreng is a traditional herb which has been used for cancer treatment as well as an aphrodisiac. The scientific literature strongly supports its in vitro antiproliferative effects on cancer cell lines and has suggested developing this plant as a potential anticancer drug. However, the in vivo steroidogenic activity and toxicity of this plant have never been tested. We analyzed the levels of five key isoflavones in the plant extract by quantitative HPLC and then evaluated the in vivo estrogenic activity and toxicity in ovariectomized rats, in comparison with the phytoestrogen-rich plant, Pueraria mirifica. Twenty rats were first ovariectomized, and then seven days later divided into four groups and gavaged daily with 0, 10 and 100 mg/kg body weight/day of S. venosa, or 100 mg/kg body weight/day of P. mirifica for 28 days. A trace amount of puerarin, daidzin and daidzein with a subtle amount of genistein and genistin were isolated from the S. venosa tuber extract. S. venosa tuber powder, at both doses, did not exhibit any detectable estrogenic activity in ovariectomized rats, as assessed by the vaginal cytology and uterotropic assays, whilst P. mirifica induced a remarkable vaginal and uterine proliferation. S. venosa induced a toxicological effect on the hematological values and histopathological appearance of metabolic organs. Taken together, these results suggest that S. venosa has no discernable estrogenic activity but that it is toxic, at least to ovariectomized rats. Thus, the use of this plant for anticancer treatment needs to be reassessed or used with caution.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:42.271Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:42.271Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6775a230491a661faa4010","title":"Biomarkers for drug-induced liver injury","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1586/egh.10.8","abstract":"Of the estimated 10,000 documented human drugs, more than 1000 have been associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI), although causality has not always been established clearly.

Methods: We used computerized literature searches in English and Chinese and examined texts written before these computerized databases existed. We used search terms of treatment and neurobiology of herbal medicines, and acupuncture for drug abuse and dependence. Results: Acupuncture showed evidence for clinical efficacy and relevant neurobiological mechanisms in opiate withdrawal, but it showed poor efficacy for alcohol and nicotine withdrawal or relapse prevention, and no large studies supported its efficacy for cocaine in well-designed clinical trials. Clinical trials were rare for herbal remedies. Radix Puerariae showed the most promising efficacy for alcoholism by acting through daidzin, which inhibits mitocochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 and leads to disulfiram-like alcohol reactions. Peyote also has some evidence for alcoholism treatment among Native Americans. Ginseng and Kava lack efficacy data in addictions, and Kava can be hepatotoxic. Thunbergia laurifolia can protect against alcoholic liver toxicity. Withania somnifera and Salvia miltiorrhiza have no efficacy data, but can reduce morphine tolerance and alcohol intake, respectively, in animal models. Conclusions: Traditional herbal treatments can compliment pharmacotherapies for drug withdrawal and possibly relapse prevention with less expense and perhaps fewer side effects with notable exceptions.

The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the data characterizing the potential for these compounds to act as substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of human drug metabolizing enzymes, with the aim of clarifying the significance of these properties in clinical care and drug interactions. In vitro data were identified that characterize cytochrome P-450 (CYP-450) enzymes as potential significant contributors to the primary metabolism of several exogenous cannabinoids: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; CYPs 2C9, 3A4); cannabidiol (CBD; CYPs 2C19, 3A4); cannabinol (CBN; CYPs 2C9, 3A4); JWH-018 (CYPs 1A2, 2C9); and AM2201 (CYPs 1A2, 2C9). CYP-450 enzymes may also contribute to the secondary metabolism of THC, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases have been identified as capable of catalyzing both primary (CBD, CBN) and secondary (THC, JWH-018, JWH-073) cannabinoid metabolism. Clinical pharmacogenetic data further support CYP2C9 as a significant contributor to THC metabolism, and a pharmacokinetic interaction study using ketoconazole with oromucosal cannabis extract further supports CYP3A4 as a significant metabolic pathway for THC and CBD. However, the absence of interaction between CBD from oromucosal cannabis extract with omeprazole suggests a less significant role of CYP2C19 in CBD metabolism. Studies of THC, CBD, and CBN inhibition and induction of major human CYP-450 isoforms generally reflect a low risk of clinically significant drug interactions with most use, but specific human data are lacking.

The results indicated that apigenin (Api), curcumol (Cur) and praeruptorin A (Pra A) were identified as potent activators of hPXR, and Pra A was also a ligand of hCAR.3. Furthermore, CYP2B6 mRNA expression in LS174T cells treated with the three herbal ingredients was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. By combining western blot and LC–MS/MS, CYP2B6 protein expression and catalytic activity induced by the three herbal ingredients were measured.4. Our observation showed Api and Cur up-regulated CYP2B6 expression by transactivation of hPXR, and Pra A acted as the ligand of both hPXR and hCAR to induce CYP2B6 expression.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:53.404Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:30:53.404Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6775ad30491a661faa4019","title":"Herbs–Are they Safe Enough? An Overview","link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408398.2010.512426","abstract":" Drugs based on herbs have become a common form of therapy as well as for prophylaxis because they are often perceived as being natural and therefore harmless. Today they are one of the hottest trends and most sought after in the field of nutrition or herbal therapeutics. As the use of complementary medicine grows, so does the knowledge that many compounds in common use not only have a significant effect on the body but may also interact with pharmaceuticals and also with other alternative products. Concurrent use of herbs with drugs may mimic, magnify, or oppose the effect of drugs leading to herb-drug interactions. Currently, there is very little information published on herb-herb or herb-drug interactions as compared to the use of herbs which is progressively growing across the world. Many reports of herb-drug interactions are sketchy and lack laboratory analysis of suspect preparations. Health-care practitioners should caution patients against mixing herbs and pharmaceutical drugs. The article reviews the recent literature on the adverse effects of herbal remedies including the most widely sold herbal medicinal products, like liquorice, garlic, ginger, green tea, and turmeric, etc., and reinforce the safety aspect of herbal products, which are considered to be relatively safe by common people.

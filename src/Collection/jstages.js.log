Adverse effects cited from ginseng use are insomnia, menstrual problems, breast pain, increased heart rate, negative effects on blood pressure, headache, loss of appetite, diarrhea, itching, rash, dizziness, mood changes, vaginal bleeding, and others. Even such serious uncommeon side effects as Steven-Johnson syndrome and liver damage from ginseng use have been claimed to have taken place. People with diabetes and heart-diseae patients who can benefit from ginseng use are warned not to use ginseng.For ginseng use to be widely accepted, it is clear to produce scientific and objective evidence that ginseng use is safe and effective. To this end, both interventional and non-interventional studies are needed. In my presentation, I will propose a number of safety and medicinal effect studies.

CAMS in the 1980s. It was showed to be effective in anti-epilepsy. Soon it was synthesized as a racemic form, dl-3-n-butylphalide (dl-NBP) and demonstrated that dl-NBP had the similar pharmacological effects compared to l-NBP. In 1990s dl-NBP was found to be potent in protection of brain injury from cerebral ischemia in animal models. It was approved by SFDA for clinical trial and was approved as a new drug for acute ischemic stroke in 2005. Today, dl-NBP is a frequently used drug for treatment of ischemic stroke in China.The pharmacological study showed that l-NBP/dl-NBP inhibited ADP induced platelet aggregation through P2Y12 receptor signaling pathways, reduced thrombus formation, increased regional cerebral blood flow, protected the function of mitochondria and inhibited the cell apoptosis during cerebral ischemia. It was also found that l-NBP could significantly enhance hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroplasticity after cerebral ischemia in rats. The activation effects of CREB and Akt and inhibitory effect of STAT3 signaling pathways might be involved in.Furthermore, we found recently that dl-NBP/dl-NBP had very interesting effects except its anti-stroke. NBP may reduce the levels of beta-amyloid and tau phosphorylation in cell lines, brains of aged rats and transgenic mice model of Alzheimer's disease. The targets of NBP for above effects might be PKC related signal transduction system and the GSK3beta as well as CDK5, respectively. NBP may improve the cognitive ability was also seen in AD and VAD animal models. Therefore, NBP appears to be promising as a multi-target drug for the prevention and/or treatment of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. It has been in phase 2, 3 clinic trial for dementia.

Transgenic mice expressing P301L mutant tau, rTg4510 mice, show significant tau pathological changes and are widely used in the studies of AD. Cornel iridoid glycoside (CIG) is the active ingredient extracted from Cornus officinalis, a traditional Chinese herb widely used for treatment of dementia and other age-related diseases in China. In our previous study, CIG could decrease the tau hyperphosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Whether CIG shows beneficial effects on rTg4510 mouse model remains unknown. Methods: In the present study, rTg4510 mice were treated with CIG for 3 months. The cognition and hyper-exploratory phenotypes of rTg4510 mice were evaluated after CIG treatment in this study. Western blot and immunofluorescence were performed to detect the levels of tau phosphorylation, phosphorylation related enzymes, cytoskeletal associated proteins and synaptic proteins. Serine/threonine phosphatase assay was applied to investigate the activity of PP2A. Results: In the present study, CIG increased the spatial and working memory, improved the objective recognition memory and decreased the hyper-exploratory phenotype of rTg4510 mice. CIG was found to prevent the brain atrophy and neuronal loss. Besides, CIG elevated the expression levels of cytoskeleton associated proteins, synaptic proteins and protected the cytoskeleton. And CIG tau reduced hyperphosphorylation tau and pathological tau depositions. And CIG could increase the activity of Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a key phosphatase in dephosphorylating tau, and decrease the demethylation of PP2Ac at leucine 309 and phosphorylation at tyrosine 307. And CIG increased the ratio of leucine carboxyl methyltransferase and methylesterase, and evaluated the level of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and Protein Phosphatase 2A Phosphatase Activator (PTPA). Discussion: In the present study, CIG treatment improved the cognitive and psychology behaviors, prevented the brain atrophy and neuronal loss. Besides, CIG protected the cytoskeleton and synapse, by decreasing the hyperphosphorylation tau and tau pathology. And the mechanisms of reducing tau phosphorylation might due to the increase of PP2A activity and PTPA expression after CIG treatment. In conclusion, CIG might be a potential drug for AD targeting PTPA, a endogenous activator of PP2A.

In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of AL-1 in C57BL/6 mice with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. The body weight loss and length change of colon after TNBS instillation were more severe than those in normal mice. AL-1 treatment led to significant reductions in disease activity index (DAI), macroscopic score and colon mucosa damage index (CMDI) associated with TNBS administration. AL-1 inhibited the inflammatory response via lowering the level of inflammatory cytokines and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. AL-1 attenuated the expression of p-p65, p-IkBa and COX-2 in the colitis mice. The alleviation of colon injury by AL-1 treatment was also evidenced by the increased expression of PPAR-r.

The extract of PL has photoprotective property including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect in the context of sunburn. In recent years it has been recognized that oral intake of PL extract demonstrates a potential as adjuncts to sunscreen protection. However, PL extract is available as a herbal supplement, therefore, its safety during medication has not been adequately investigated. The present study was conducted to evaluate the herb-drug interaction with PL extract mediated by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibition and induction.[Methods] Midazolam (MDZ) was used as a probe drug for CYP3A activity. The inhibitory effect of PL extract (Heliocare®) and its major phenolic components, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and vanillic acid on MDZ 1'-hydroxylation (MDZ 1'-OH) activity was assayed using pooled human liver microsomes in vitro. In vivo studies were performed using rats. The pharmacokinetics of MDZ was investigated after single or one week administration of PL extract (60 mg/kg) to evaluate its inhibitory and inducible effect on CYP3A, respectively. MDZ (15 mg/kg) was administered orally 24 hours after last dose of PL extract in the one-week treatment study, while their interval was 0.5 or 2 hours in the single treatment study. Serum MDZ concentrations were analyzed and its pharmacokinetic parameters were compared with a water-treated control group. [Results] PL extract decreased CYP3A-mediated MDZ 1'-OH activity in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. However, the inhibitory effects of the activity by five phenolic compounds were negligible. Therefore, it was suggested that CYP3A inhibition was caused by other than these compounds contained in PL extract. In the in vivo study, AUC and Cmax of MDZ were significantly increased by 57% and 88%, respectively (p<0.05) when single PL extract was administered 0.5 hours before MDZ. In contrast, one-week treatment of PL extract did not show any remarkable change in MDZ pharmacokinetic parameters, suggesting the extract unlikely induce CYP3A.[Conclusion]PL extract inhibited CYP3A-mediated MDZ metabolism in vitro and in vivo. These results suggested that PL extract may lead herb-drug interactions through the inhibition of CYP3A.","year":"2018","createdAt":"2020-10-14T12:08:18.579Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T12:08:18.579Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f86eab96a1b9e1d186e2cd5","title":"Outpatient Prescriptions of Kampo Formulations in Japan","link":"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/internalmedicine/advpub/0/advpub_5012-20/_article/-char/en","abstract":" Objective Kampo is a traditional Japanese medicine using formulae of natural agents.

Curcumin is an herb with broad-spectrum antibacterial activities and has been shown to have synergistic effects with other antibiotics. To date, its antimicrobial activity has been investigated only in vitro and pre-clinical studies and human pharmacokinetic data are available for other therapeutic strategies. Nevertheless, the administration of existing curcumin formulations does not result in sufficient exposure for antimicrobial treatment. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling has been used to predict drug distribution and simulate clinical scenarios in virtual patients. The objective of this study was to develop a PBPK model for predicting optimal dosage through enhancement of curcumin absorption (Ka) for multi-microorganism treatment in adults.MethodsA whole-PBPK model was built based on human physiological parameters and drug specific parameters. Average-folding errors (AFEs) of the area under the curve (AUC) and maximum blood concentration (Cmax) of simulated results from 100 virtual populations were compared to clinical data and further validated with different dosage regimens. The predicted clearance (CL), volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), half-life (t1/2) and oral bioavailability (F) were reported as mean (SD) values. Optimal AUC and Cmax for antimicrobial activities were determined using PK/PD indices: AUC/MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) >125 and Cmax/MIC > 10.ResultsThe AFEs for model prediction and model validation were within 1.5-and 2-fold of clinical observed data, respectively. Model prediction of CL (L/h), Vss (L), t1/2(hr) and F was 28.53 (1.3), 2.3 (0.35), 3.85 (0.71) and 0.98%, respectively. Theoretical benefits were simulated considering effect on Ka and optimized PK/PD indices were achieved at a dose of 500 mg T.I.D. with Ka=10h-1ConclusionsThe PBPK approach supported the simulation of curcumin pharmacokinetics and prediction of the antimicrobial activity, suggesting that the curcumin formulation could be improved and possibly be successful for treatment of resistant bacteria.

The comparison of products by the analysis showed that the quantity of each ingredient differed by products; furthermore, the count test of bacteria number proved that some products held a possibility of microbial contamination.

This study sought to investigate the underlying mechanisms of BSNXD in terms of receptor activation of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro because of the critical roles of bone resorption in the development and progression of osteoporosis. In mice, serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and 17-β-estradiol (E2) were evaluated with an enzyme immunoassay kit after ovariectomy. Levels of DHEA and DHEAS increased significantly following administration of BSNXD while the level of E2 did not. In addition, tartrate-resistance acid phosphatase staining showed that DHEA profoundly inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro in a dose-dependent manner via estrogen receptor α (ERα) but not via estrogen receptor β or androgen receptors. Cytotoxicity was not detected in the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. These data suggest that BSNXD prevents PMO by increasing DHEA via the ERαpathway to suppress osteoclastogenesis.

To investigate the protective effect of SKI306X on cartilage catabolism, we assessed collagen degradation in rabbit cartilage explants treated with interleukin-1α up to 3 weeks.

The cytotoxic activity of arucanolide was observed at lower concentrations compared to that of parthenolide, which has been reported to be a typical and simple germacranolide. The activity was found to be mainly due to apoptosis that was assessed by morphological findings, DNA ladder formation (24 – 36 h), and flow cytometric analysis in HL60 cells.

However, the mitochondrial membrane potential of HL60 cells was lost after 24-h treatment with arucanolide, and concurrently apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) released from mitochondria was detected by Western blot analysis. The inactivation of nuclear factor-κB, which has been commonly shown in parthenolide-induced apoptosis, did not occur in arucanolide-induced apoptosis.

These treatments also reduced the loss of cholinergic immunoreactivity in the hippocampus induced by ibotenic acid.

Since Pd-Ia (3'-angeloyloxy-4'-acetoxy-3', 4'-dihydroseselin) causes relaxation of smooth muscle unhibiting calcium influx, and since mediator release is a calcium-dependent process, studies were made on whether coumarins block calcium influx into rat mast cells stimulated by concanavalin A. Pd-Ia isolated from Peucedanum praeruptorum DUNN and related compounds, named Pd-C-II, Pd-C-III and Pd-C-IV, from Peucedanum decursivum MAXIM., (Angelica decursiva FR. et SAV.) inhibited mediator release from purified mast cells induced by concanavalin A with phosphatidylserine; their IC50 values were 79, 100, 102 and 73 μM, respectively. Pd-III, decursidin and water-soluble analogues of Pd-Ia (Pd-Ia-OH, Pd-Ia-OCH2CH3) did not inhibit the release. Thus the inhibitory actions of coumarins on calcium influx seemed to depend on the chemical structures of these compounds ; an acetoxyl residue at position 3' or 4' on the seselin or xanthyletin skeleton might be essential for an inhibitory. Furthermore, Pd-Ia and Pc-C-III caused more than 40% reduction in 45Ca uptake induced by concanavalin A, whereas decursidin had little effect on it. Therefore, the inhibitions of mediator release of mast cells by some of coumarins from \"Qian-Hu\" seem to depend on their effect in blocking calcium influx.

The present study is designed to investigate the protection of an ethanol extract of Angelica sinensis (Oliv) Diels (AE) against an ethyl acetate fraction of D. bulbifera (EF)-induced liver injury and its engaged mechanism. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that the amount of diosbulbin B in EF was 16.03% and ferulic acid in AE was 0.18%. EF (350 mg/kg) increased serum alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and total bilirubin (TB) amount, while AE inhibited such an increase. Liver histological evaluation showed that AE prevented development of severe hepatic lesions induced by EF. Further results showed that EF decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and induced the cleaved activation of caspase-9 and -3, and all those effects were reversed by AE. AE also reversed EF-induced decreased expression of the inhibitor of kappa B (IκB), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx).

Chemotherapy is one of three major therapeutic methods for cancer treatment, but cancer cells gradually evolve resistance to chemotherapeutic reagents. For centuries, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) was used to fight against cancer. In recent years, a number of effective component mechanisms of TCM have been increasingly illuminated. As we know, chemical structures of reagents decide or affect their activities on target pathways. Thus, we classified some antitumor-related TCM components reported in the last five years into thirteen groups by their chemical structures, such as, alkaloids, diterpenoids, triterpenes, sesquiterpenes, anthraquinones, benzoquinones, flavonoids, berbamines, xanthones, saponins, steroids, polysaccharides, and glycosides. In various cancer cell lines, these constituents target dozens of signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo. Among these components, there are three sets: i) mainly apoptosis-related groups, such as, alkaloids, diterpenoids, anthraquinones, berbamines, and xanthones, target pathways like the mitochondrial pathway, NF-κB pathway, p53 pathway and so on; ii) mainly proliferation, invasion and metastasis-related groups, such as, triterpenes, sesquiterpenes, polysaccharides, and glycosides, target pathways like the mTOR pathway, β-catenin pathway, ERK pathway and so on; iii) both apoptosis and proliferation, invasion and metastasis-related groups, such as benzoquinones, flavonoids, saponins, and steroids, target the pathways in i) and ii) synchronously. These will provide association information between TCM components and signaling pathways to promote studies on mechanisms of effective constituents, target drug development, and combinational chemotherapy.

The traditional industries form the major consumer of the tuberous roots as these are used in many ayurvedic preparations. The present work investigates the prospects of utilizing hairy roots in the place of tuberous roots based on bacterial survival test of hairy roots and comparison through phytochemical analyses (TLC, Spectrophotometry, HPLC and LC-MS). Since the traditional system of medicine follows stringent curing procedure before incorporation of the roots in medicinal preparations, cured tuberous and hairy roots were also compared. The phytochemical profile of hairy roots was remarkably similar to that of tuberous roots. Curing caused no change in the phytotchemical composition of the roots but only a reduction in the amount of plumbagin and other molecules. Plumbagin was reduced to 0.372 ± 0.026% dry weight (DW) in cured tuberous roots (1.15 ± 0.08% DW in uncured) and 0.061± 0.0043% DW in cured hairy roots (1.32 ± 0.09% DW in uncured). An 11.3 fold increase in root biomass with 1.56% g DW plumbagin obtained in bioreactor as against 5.39 fold in shake-flasks (with 1% w/v inoculum over 3 weeks period), adds to the prospects of its applicability in traditional systems. The results suggest a refurbishment of conventional high quantity cured roots in traditional preparations with low quantity uncured roots, irrespective of root types.

To evaluate PBLs effect on the immune system mice were treated with different doses of PBL via gavage and sacrificed 4 weeks later. PBLs were shown to be rich in vitamin E, unsaturated fatty acids, and other immune-potentiating compounds. Treatment with PBLs increased the spleen index and stimulated spleen and thymus development. In addition, PBLs increased the number of CD3+CD4+ cells in the peripheral blood and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ cells while decreasing the number of CD3+CD8+ cells. Moreover, PBLs significantly increased IL-4 and IFN-γ levels in mouse serum and TLR4 mRNA and protein expression in the spleen. Taken together these results demonstrate that PBLs exert their immune-potentiating effects by promoting spleen and thymus development, T lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation, and immune factor expression. These immune-potentiating effects may be related to the activation of TLR4.

Male ICR mice from 3 groups (n=8 per group) were orally administered LOE for 4 weeks at 0 (vehicle), 61.5 (LOE-1X) or 307.5 (LOE-5X) mg/kg/day. LOE supplementation was able to dose-dependently increase endurance swimming time (P<0.0001) and decrease levels of serum lactate (P=0.0022), ammonia (P<0.0001), creatine kinase (P<0.0001), blood urea nitrogen (P<0.0001) and glucose utilization (P<0.0001) after acute exercise challenge. The glycogen in gastrocnemius muscle also increased with LOE treatment in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.0001). Biochemically, AST, ALT, LDH, CK, BUN, creatinine and UA levels were decreased with LOE treatment. Our study shows that 4-week supplementation with LOE increases muscle glycogen content storage to enhance exercise performance and anti-fatigue effects.","year":"2019","createdAt":"2020-10-14T12:14:49.412Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T12:14:49.412Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f86ebb96a1b9e1d186e2d0b","title":"Antiparasitic agents produced by microorganisms","link":"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/pjab/80/6/80_6_245/_article/-char/en","abstract":" Microorganisms produce many useful antiparasitic agents.

P. tunicoides is initially placed in Silene L., but P. tunicoides is different from Silene L. in the basic chromosome number of x=10 and 12. The results of this study support the view that P. tunicoides is turned into the independent genus from Silene L. Combining the available chromosome studies of Saponaria L. and Psammosilene tunicoides, the two species have relatively consistent chromosome diversification with a basic number of 14, and most species of the Saponaria L. contain diploid individuals, which suggested that there are certain phylogenetic relationships between Psammosilene tunicoides and Saponaria L.

Methods of detecting oxidatively modified substances as new markers by mass spectrography (MS) have been developed. Oxidative modifications of highly reactive cysteine residues in several target proteins such as tyrosine phosphatase and thioredoxin-related proteins control the functions of relevant molecules, and thereby play an important role in signal transmission. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) gradually accumulate with aging and are involved in the development of diabetic complications, Alzheimer's disease, and arteriosclerosis. Basic studies of the indicators of glycation are also important.This general article outlines oxidative stress markers with a focus on oxidative modification of proteins and glycation of proteins, both of which have received attention in recent years, and introduces information regarding newly discovered markers for oxidative stress.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an established segment of the health care system in China. Currently, it is widely used for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in China and many parts of the world. Over a long period of time in clinical practice and in basic research progress, the effectiveness and beneficial contribution of TCM on CHB have been gradually known and confirmed. Based upon our review of related papers and because of our prior knowledge and experience, we have selected some Chinese medicines, including Chinese herbal formulas (e.g., Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang, Xiao-Yao-San, and LongDan-Xie-Gan-Tang), single herbs (e.g., Phyllanthus niruri, Radix astragali, Polygonum cuspidatum, Rheum palmatum, and Salvia miltiorrhiza) and related active compounds (e.g., wogonin, artesunate, saikosaponin, astragaloside IV, and chrysophanol 8-O-beta-D glucoside) and Chinese medicine preparations (e.g., silymarin, silibinin, kushenin, and cinobufacini), which seem effective and worthy of additional and indepth study in treating CHB, and we have given them a brief review. We conclude that these Chinese herbal medicines exhibit significant anti-HBV activities with improved liver function, and enhanced HBeAg and HBsAg sero-conversion rates as well as HBV DNA clearance rates in HepG2 2.2.15 cells, DHBV models, or patients with CHB. We hope this review will contribute to an understanding of TCM and related active compounds as an effective treatment for CHB and provide useful information for the development of more effective antiviral drugs.

Although research on this disease is advancing rapidly, thus far few very effective drugs are available for AD patients. The currently widely used medicines such as donepezil and galantamine transiently improve the symptoms of patients with mild to moderate AD. They are hardly capable of preventing, halting or reversing the progression of this disease. In the long history of development of traditional Chinese medicine, many herbs have been discovered and employed to treat dementia diseases in clinics in China. In recent decades, a number of agents were isolated from these herbs and their efficacies against AD were tested. Some flavonoids, alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, triterpenoid saponins, and polysaccharides were demonstrated to have potential efficacies against AD via targeting multiple pathological changes of this disease. In this article, we reviewed research progress on the efficacies and underlying mechanisms of these agents.

However, due to the presence of a carbonyl group, reducing sugars such as glucose react non-enzymatically with amino groups on proteins in glycation (or Maillard) reactions. This reaction is divided into early and advanced phase reactions: the former covers the reaction progression up to the Amadori rearrangement, and the latter covers the reaction through the subsequent alterations of oxidation, dehydration, condensation, and so on, eventually generating advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Among post-translational modifications, processes such as phosphorylation or acetylation are known as “post-translational modifications with order,” because the target proteins and the time of modification are controlled. However, glycation is a “post-translational modification with disorder” because post-translational modification of proteins by glucose progresses non-enzymatically, irreversibly, and at random, and because the progression depends on the existing time (aging) and the concentration of glucose, rather than the variety of proteins involved. While AGEs were initially considered simply as rust or waste matter in the body, significant attention is now afforded these compounds as a target molecule for newly-developing drugs, for the following reasons: AGEs damage the body by changing the structure and affecting the function proteins; receptors that recognizes AGEs, such as RAGE (receptor for AGE), exist in the body and mediate cellular derangements to induce morbidity; and inhibitors for AGE generation, such as aminoguanidine, pyridoxamine, and benfotiamine, delay the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy. Further, racemization proteins containing D-amino acids have been noted, along with AGEs, in drusen, which are characteristic of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Here, we introduce current topics and future goals of AGEs research, particularly with regard to kidney disease associated with aging and diabetes mellitus, and touch on the involvement of AGEs in the progression of ocular diseases and the function of RAGE.

We describe maturation-resistant, TC-conditioned dendritic cell (DC), which expressed much lower MHC class II (I-Ak) and CD86, showed reduced capacity to stimulate effector T cell responses and upregulated PD-Ll (programmed death ligand-1). TC-DC-stimulated regulatory cells (Treg) were superior alloantigen-specific suppressor of the T effector response as compared to those stimulated by control (CTR)-DC.

A time-of-addition study demonstrated that DL-CE has anti-HCV activity at both the entry and post-entry steps and markedly blocks the viral entry step through direct virucidal activity with marginal inhibition of virion assembly. Co-treatment of DL-CE with cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressant or telaprevir, an NS3 protease inhibitor, resulted in additive and synergistic antiviral effects, respectively.

Therefore, in the present study, we examined the influence of artemisinin on the acetylcholine receptor-operated potassium current (IK.ACh), a ligand-gated potassium current, in guinea pig atrial myocytes using a patch clamp technique. Artemisinin (1 to 300 μM) inhibited IK.ACh induced by extracellular application of both carbachol (1 μM) and adenosine (10 μM) and that induced by intracellular loading of GTPγS (100 μM) in a concentration-dependent manner. Artemisinin inhibited carbachol-induced, adenosine-induced, and GTPγS-activated IK.ACh within almost the same concentration range. In left atria, artemisinin (1 to 100 μM) partially reversed the shortening of action potential duration induced by carbachol in a concentration-dependent manner. Carbachol-induced negative inotropic action in left atria was also inhibited by artemisinin (10 to 300 μM). In conclusion, we suggest that the anticholinergic action of artemisinin is mediated through inhibition of IK.ACh via inhibition of the muscarinic potassium channel and/or associated GTP-binding proteins.

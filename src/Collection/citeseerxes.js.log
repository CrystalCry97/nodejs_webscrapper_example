The CYP P450 enzymes constitute a large superfamily of haem-thiolate proteins involved in the metabolism of a wide variety of both exogenous and endogenous compounds. The CYP activities have been shown to be involved in numerous interactions especially between drugs and herbal constituents. The majority of serious cases of drug interactions are as a result of the interference of the metabolic clearance of one drug by yet another co-administered drug, food or natural product. Gaining mechanistic knowledge towards such interactions has been accepted as an approach to avoid adverse reactions. The inductions and inhibition of CYP enzymes by natural products in the presence of a prescribed drug has led to adverse effects.

Herbal medicines can cause abnormal test results and confusion in proper diagnosis. Herbal medicines can alter test results by direct interference with certain immunoassays. Drug-herb interactions can result in unexpected concentrations of therapeutic drugs. For example, low concentrations of several drugs (eg, cyclosporine, theophylline, digoxin) can be observed in patients who initiated self-medication with St John’s wort.

Economic challenges associated with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and the sociocultural outlook ofmany patients especially in Africa have increased dependence on traditional herbal medicines (THMs) for these diseases. A cross-sectional descriptive study designed to determine the prevalence of and reasons for THM use in the management of NCDs among South African adults was conducted in an urban, economically disadvantaged area of Cape Town, South Africa. In a cohort of 1030 participants recruited as part of the existing Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study, 456 individuals were identified. The overall prevalence of THM use was 27%, of which 61 % was for NCDs. Participants used THM because of a family history (49%) and sociocultural beliefs (33%). Hypertensive medication was most commonly used concurrently with THM.

The prevalence of migraine headaches is 18 % in women and 6 % in men. While millions of Americans suffer from migraine headaches, roughly 3%–13 % of identified migraine patients are on preventive therapy, while an estimated 38 % actually need a preventive agent. The challenge among physicians is not only when to start a daily preventive agent but which preventive agent to choose. Circumstances warranting prevention have been described in the past, and in 2012, a new set of guidelines with an evidence review on preventive medications was published. A second set of guidelines provided evidence on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, herbs, minerals, and vitamins for prevention of episodic migraine.

This attribute of the dosage form is referred to as Physiologic availability or Biologic availability or simply availability. For most of the drugs, the pharmacologic response is directly related to the plasma levels. Thus, the term, Bioavailability is defined as the rate & extent (amount) of absorption of unchanged drug from its dosage form. Bioavailability refers to the difference between the amounts of a substance, such as a drug, herb, or chemical, to which a person is exposed and the actual dose of the substance the body receives. Bioavailability accounts for the difference between exposure and dose. A drug's therapeutic action or a chemical's toxicity is determined by the dose received at the target site in the body. The dose at the target site is determined by the amount of the substance absorbed by the body, which depends on its bioavailability. If a substance is ingested, for example, its bioavailability is determined by the amount that is absorbed by the intestinal tract. If a substance is inhaled, its bioavailability is determined by the amount that is absorbed by the lungs. Understanding bioavailability is critical to determining the amount of a drug to administer or the level of chemical exposure that is likely to produce toxicity.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T17:05:10.239Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T17:05:10.239Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f848cc649f8ba827be92ddc","title":"Herbs and Other Functional Foods in Equine Nutrition","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=96A6A8F8913134AB1217526CFE947870?doi=10.1.1.1063.7252&rank=22","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda):  Abstract A majority of the many herbs and other functional foods on the market today have not been scientifically tested; this is especially true in equine research. The following paper will review literature pertinent to herbal supplementation in horses as well as other species. Common equine supplements like, echinacea, garlic, ginger, ginseng, and yucca among many others, are not regulated and few studies have investigated a safe yet effective dose of these compounds. Ginseng is commonly studied and has been found to exert an inhibitory effect on IL-1β and IL-6 gene expression, decrease TNF-α production by macrophages, decrease cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and suppress histamine and leukotriene release. On-going studies in horses are testing the anti-inflammatory effects of a single dose of ginger, postexercise. Echinacea, a common immunostimulant, or 'cold fighter', has been reported to have an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Equine studies found that garlic fed at > 0.2 g kg -1 d -1 developed Heinz body anaemia. Yucca contains steroid-like saponins, which produce an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-spasmodic effect to reduce pain associated with arthritis. Herbs can have a drug-like action that can interact with other components in the horses' diet. Some herbs contain prohibited substances like salicylates, digitalis, heroin, cocaine and marijuana. Drug-herb interactions are also common side effects and caution needs to be taken when determining which 'natural product' to use.

Therefore, this investigation aimed at screening the effects of short term and chronic exposure of sutherlandia on oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of nevirapine (NVP), a non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, in Sprague Dawley rats. NVP (6 mg/kg) was administered orally alone (control) and with co-administration of sutherlandia; short term (12 mg/kg single dose) and long term (12mg/kg, once a day for 5 days). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters of NVP was found upon short term co-administration of Sutherlandia. However, there was a 50 % decrease (p < 0.05) in the AUC and Cmax values of NVP after 5 days of chronic exposure with Sutherlandia. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR studies demonstrated a 2–3 fold increase in the hepatic and intestinal mRNA expression of CYP3A2, relative to vehicle control. To further confirm, if this could translate into a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction in patients, we tested this hypothesis employing LS-180 cells as an in vitro induction model for human CYP3A4. Ninety six hours post treatment, similar to positive control rifampicin (25µM), sutherlandia extract (300µg/mL) resulted in elevated m-RNA expression levels and functional activity of CYP3A4 (human homologue of rodent CYP3A2) in LS-180 cells.

Diabetes is an important human ailment afflicting many from various walks of life in different countries. In India it is proving to be a major health problem, especially in the urban areas. Though there are various approaches to reduce the ill effects of diabetes and its secondary complications, herbal formulations are preferred due to lesser side effects and low cost. A list of medicinal plants with proven antidiabetic and related beneficial effects and of herbal drugs used in treatment of diabetes is compiled. These include, Allium sativum, Eugenia jambolana, Momordica charantia Ocimum sanctum, Phyllanthus amarus, Pterocarpus marsupium, Tinospora cordifolia, Trigonella foenum graecum and Withania somnifera. One of the etiologic factors implicated in the development of diabetes and its complications is the damage induced by free radicals and hence an antidiabetic compound with antioxidant properties would be more beneficial.

However, the rise in the incidence of herb-drug interactions is causing concern, especially in the absence of warning labels addressing potential adverse effects. We present he case of a 55-year-old male who suffered a fatal breakthrough seizure, with no evidence of non-compliance with his anticonvulsant medications. The autopsy report revealed sub-therapeutic serum levels for both anticonvulsants Depakote | and Dilantin |. Concomitant with his prescribed medications, the decedent was also self-medicating with a cornucopia of herbal supplements and nutraceuticals, prominent among which was Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo, an herbal extract from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, has been used medicinally for centuries and has been touted as a cure for a variety of medical conditions. The induction of Cytochrome P450 enzymes by components of herbal drugs has been known to affect the metabolism of various drugs. Dilantin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9, and secondarily metabolized by CYP2C19. Valproate metabolism is also m dulated in part by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. A recent study revealed significant inductive effect of ginkgo on CYP2C19 activity. CYP2C19 induction by ginkgo could be a plausible explanation for the subtherapeutic levels of Dilantin and Depakote. Additionally, ginkgo nuts contain a potent neurotoxin, which is known to induce seizure activity. Evidence of other herbal drugs diminishing the efficacy of anticonvulsant medication does exist; however, there has been only one other documented instance of ginkgo potentiating seizure activity in the presence of anticonvulsant therapy. Highlighting the potential adverse effects and drug interactions of ginkgo on the packaging of the drug may help prevent inadvertent use in vulnerable individuals.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T17:05:25.167Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T17:05:25.167Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f848cd549f8ba827be92dec","title":"RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Evaluation of the transporter-mediated herb-drug","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=F64905EAA029DD153FA6FBA4E976E367?doi=10.1.1.812.3602&rank=38","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): interaction potential of DA-9801, a standardized","createdAt":"2020-10-12T17:05:25.167Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T17:05:25.167Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f848cd549f8ba827be92ded","title":"Research Article www.ijptonline.com HERBAL MEDICATION: HERB-DRUG INTERACTIONS AND PATIENT PSYCHOANALYSIS","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=F64905EAA029DD153FA6FBA4E976E367?doi=10.1.1.248.4511&rank=39","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Many medicinal herbs and pharmaceutical drugs are therapeutic at one dose and toxic at another.

The present study was intended to determine the interaction between glibenclamide and methanolic extract of bark of Pongamia glabra Vent. (PBME), a herb with reported antidiabetic effect. The interaction was evaluated in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rats using the parameters such as glucose tolerance test, acute and sub-acute levels of antidiabetic study and body weight estimations at various intervals. Glibenclamide was administered orally at two different doses of 300 µg/kg (low dose) and 600 µg/kg (high dose) and PBME was co-administered at the dose of 200 mg/kg. Individual treatments of above drugs were also carried out. Significant (P<0.001) hypoglycemic effect was observed with the combination therapy of glibenclamide and PBME compared to their individual treatments in the above studied parameters. The combination therapy showed more percentage increase in body weight than the individual treatments. The study indicates that the present herb-drug interaction was beneficial as PBME showed synergistic effect with glibenclamide. This could provide an opportunity to reduce the dose of glibenclamide to achieve an enhanced therapeutic effect with minimal side effects.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T17:05:25.167Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T17:05:25.167Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f848ce849f8ba827be92def","title":"Traditional drugs Food items (2012)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=225F1FE7ED65079A1367F74C311EDBCF?doi=10.1.1.705.8630&rank=1","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): nd","createdAt":"2020-10-12T17:05:44.351Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T17:05:44.351Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f848ce849f8ba827be92df1","title":"Food Drug, Food Protein Interactions Correspondence to Author:","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=225F1FE7ED65079A1367F74C311EDBCF?doi=10.1.1.300.4417&rank=3","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Ferulic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid) is an phenolic compound and an antioxidant found in many staple foods, such as fruits, vegetables, cereals, coffee and in plant constituent exhibiting a wide range of therapeutic effects such as anticancer, antidiabetic, cardio protective and neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory activity.

Established anticoagulants are not ideal, due to requirements for parenteral administration, narrow therapeutic indices, and/or a need for frequent therapeutic monitoring. The development of effective oral anticoagulants that are administered as a fixed dose, have low potential for drug-drug and drug-food interactions, do not require regular anticoagulation monitoring, and are suitable for both inpatient and outpatient use is to be welcomed.

The aim of the study was to investigate the gaps in nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and practices and their relationship with sociodemographic characteristics in an urban population of women living with HIV and AIDS in Uganda. In total, 133 women living with HIV were interviewed using a pretested questionnaire. Most (89.5%) women reported being trained on the importance of nutrition for people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) and believed that it is very important to consume a balanced diet (99.5%).

In this study, the effects of acute (5.0 mg/kg) and chronic (5.0 mg/kg, 22 days) FLX were investigated in both fooddeprived and non-deprived rats tested in the elevated plus-maze. Significant main effects of the three factors (drug, food condition and administration regimen) were observed, but no interaction between them. The administration of either acute or chronic FLX resulted in an anxiogenic effect, as detected by a significant reduction in the percentage of time spent in the open arms and in the percentage of open arm entries. Food deprivation yielded an anxiolytic-like profile, probably related to changes in locomotor activity. The administration regimen resulted in an anxiolytic profile in chronically treated rats, as would be expected after 22 days of regular handling. The anxiogenic action of acute FLX is consistent with both its neurochemical and clinical profile. The discrepancy between the anxiogenic profile of chronic FLX and its therapeutic uses is discussed in terms of possible differences between the type of anxiety that is measured in the plus-maze and the types of human anxiety that are alleviated by fluoxetine.

A small study identified a lack of pa-tient knowledge regarding the important aspects of war-farin therapy as a determinant of nonadherence to therapy.7 Another investigation showed a weak but significant posi-tive relationship between warfarin knowledge and antico-agulation control. In this study, knowledge was assessed using 9 open-ended questions covering topics including in-dication, tablet identification, effects of nonadherence, and supra- or subtherapeutic anticoagulation.6 Kagansky et al.8 evaluated risk factors for bleeding among older patients on warfarin and found insufficient education to be a major factor predicting bleeding episodes.

Several of these compounds have been found to enhance the incidence of liver tumors in animals briefly exposed previously to hepatocarcinogens. Accordingly, it has been advanced that these agents act as tumor promoters. This contention has remained subject of controversy following reports that these substances may also cause liver tumors in noncarcinogen-treated rodents, particularly in those characterized by a relatively high incidence of \"spontaneous \" liver tumors. Since many of these chemicals are in common use, a crucial question would seem to be whether such effects are due to facilitation of the expression of pre-existing oncogenic potential, i.e., to tumor promotion, or to the synergistic action of weakly carcinogenic agents. As a result of mechanistic differences tumor promotion and syn-carcinogenesis must exhibit different dose-time-response characteristics, and, accordingly, it should be possible, in principle, to discriminate between these phenomena. However, since tumor manifestation periods in low-dose groups frequently exceed the animals average lifespan, this approach may not always yield conclusive data, unless a sensitive early marker of carcinogenic activity can be employed.

Anaphylaxis is the maximal variant of an acute allergic reaction involving several organ systems. The phenomenon itself is old, but it was recognized and named at the beginning of the 20th century by Richet and Portier. The clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis a¡ect various organs, most commonly starting in the skin and proceeding to the respiratory tract, to gastrointestinal involvement and to cardiovascular symptoms, and ¢nally to cardiac and/or respiratory arrest. Anaphylaxis stricto sensu is an immunological reaction, mostly mediated by IgE antibodies, but also by IgG or IgM antibodies (immune complex anaphylaxis). There are cases with similar clinical symptomatology without detectable immunological sensitization which are called pseudo-allergic or anaphylactoid reactions. In the newer nomenclature, some authors tend to include these under the heading of ‘anaphylaxis ’ which has then to be de¢ned as an acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction. The most common elicitors of anaphylaxis include drugs, foods, additives, but also other allergens as well as physical factors (cold, heat, UV radiation).

Piperazine derivatives, mainly the isomers of 1-chlorophenylpiperazine (especially the 1,3-isomer, m-CPP), 1-benzylpiperazine (BzP) and 1-[3-trifluoromethylphenyl]-piperazine (TFMPP), increasingly appear on the illicit drug market as active substances in Ecstasy tablets and “smart drugs”. A CE-ESI-MS/MS procedure with a run buffer consisting of 100 mmol/L formic acid at pH 2.4 and 10 % (v/v) 2-propanol in a 75 µm i.d. fused-silica capillary of 82 cm length was employed for the separation and identification of five piperazines (MS conditions: dry gas flow: 4 L/min at 250°C, nebulizer gas pressure: 4 psi, sheath liquid: 2-propanol/water (50/50, v/v) at 3 µL/min). Baseline separation was achieved within 13 minutes using a high voltage of +25 kV. A second tailor-made procedure for the baseline separation of the three positional isomers of 1-chloro-phenylpiperazine (o-CPP, m-CPP and p-CPP) at +28 kV was developed by adding 10 mmol/L 2-hy-droxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin to the separation buffer.

Management of warfarin drug interactions is often complicated by lack of information regarding interactions with new drugs and with herbal medic-inals. The pharmaceutical industry has increased both the number and quality of drug interaction studies prior to marketing new agents. Interactions may still occur in patients, however, despite negative pre-marketing studies in healthy volunteers. The clinical significance and intensity of warfarin interactions with prescription drugs (e.g., celecoxib, proton pump inhibitors, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) can often be predicted on the basis of known metabolic characteristics of the drugs and warfarin enantiomers. Drug interactions with herbal medicinals are much more difficult to characterize and predict because of the lack of federal regulations regarding safety, effi-cacy, and manufacturing standards. Published case reports of interactions between warfarin and even the most widely used herbal medicinals are limited.

The CYP P450 enzymes constitute a large superfamily of haem-thiolate proteins involved in the metabolism of a wide variety of both exogenous and endogenous compounds. The CYP activities have been shown to be involved in numerous interactions especially between drugs and herbal constituents. The majority of serious cases of drug interactions are as a result of the interference of the metabolic clearance of one drug by yet another co-administered drug, food or natural product.

The overall prevalence of THM use was 27%, of which 61 % was for NCDs. Participants used THM because of a family history (49%) and sociocultural beliefs (33%). Hypertensive medication was most commonly used concurrently with THM. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the potential dualistic use of THM and conventional drugs by patients, as this could significantly influence health outcomes. Efforts should be made to educate patients on the potential for drug/herb interactions. 1.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:00:32.313Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:00:32.313Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b5e06d7b5ad7298c9005","title":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 2013:9 709–720 Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Preventive treatment in migraine and the new US guidelines","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=6D6345A3FC237D301C3E3E9B7D0730B0?doi=10.1.1.789.4189&rank=16","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Abstract: Migraine headaches are among the most common headache disorders seen in various practices.

Circumstances warranting prevention have been described in the past, and in 2012, a new set of guidelines with an evidence review on preventive medications was published. A second set of guidelines provided evidence on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, herbs, minerals, and vitamins for prevention of episodic migraine.

This attribute of the dosage form is referred to as Physiologic availability or Biologic availability or simply availability. For most of the drugs, the pharmacologic response is directly related to the plasma levels. Thus, the term, Bioavailability is defined as the rate & extent (amount) of absorption of unchanged drug from its dosage form. Bioavailability refers to the difference between the amounts of a substance, such as a drug, herb, or chemical, to which a person is exposed and the actual dose of the substance the body receives. Bioavailability accounts for the difference between exposure and dose. A drug's therapeutic action or a chemical's toxicity is determined by the dose received at the target site in the body. The dose at the target site is determined by the amount of the substance absorbed by the body, which depends on its bioavailability. If a substance is ingested, for example, its bioavailability is determined by the amount that is absorbed by the intestinal tract. If a substance is inhaled, its bioavailability is determined by the amount that is absorbed by the lungs. Understanding bioavailability is critical to determining the amount of a drug to administer or the level of chemical exposure that is likely to produce toxicity.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:00:43.713Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:00:43.713Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b5eb6d7b5ad7298c900b","title":"Herbs and Other Functional Foods in Equine Nutrition","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=07424C6088A7F18996388980616D154D?doi=10.1.1.1063.7252&rank=22","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda):  Abstract A majority of the many herbs and other functional foods on the market today have not been scientifically tested; this is especially true in equine research. The following paper will review literature pertinent to herbal supplementation in horses as well as other species. Common equine supplements like, echinacea, garlic, ginger, ginseng, and yucca among many others, are not regulated and few studies have investigated a safe yet effective dose of these compounds. Ginseng is commonly studied and has been found to exert an inhibitory effect on IL-1β and IL-6 gene expression, decrease TNF-α production by macrophages, decrease cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and suppress histamine and leukotriene release. On-going studies in horses are testing the anti-inflammatory effects of a single dose of ginger, postexercise. Echinacea, a common immunostimulant, or 'cold fighter', has been reported to have an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Equine studies found that garlic fed at > 0.2 g kg -1 d -1 developed Heinz body anaemia. Yucca contains steroid-like saponins, which produce an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-spasmodic effect to reduce pain associated with arthritis. Herbs can have a drug-like action that can interact with other components in the horses' diet. Some herbs contain prohibited substances like salicylates, digitalis, heroin, cocaine and marijuana. Drug-herb interactions are also common side effects and caution needs to be taken when determining which 'natural product' to use.

However, no reports yet exist delineating the effect of sutherlandia on pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral agents. Therefore, this investigation aimed at screening the effects of short term and chronic exposure of sutherlandia on oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of nevirapine (NVP), a non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, in Sprague Dawley rats. NVP (6 mg/kg) was administered orally alone (control) and with co-administration of sutherlandia; short term (12 mg/kg single dose) and long term (12mg/kg, once a day for 5 days). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters of NVP was found upon short term co-administration of Sutherlandia. However, there was a 50 % decrease (p < 0.05) in the AUC and Cmax values of NVP after 5 days of chronic exposure with Sutherlandia. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR studies demonstrated a 2–3 fold increase in the hepatic and intestinal mRNA expression of CYP3A2, relative to vehicle control. To further confirm, if this could translate into a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction in patients, we tested this hypothesis employing LS-180 cells as an in vitro induction model for human CYP3A4. Ninety six hours post treatment, similar to positive control rifampicin (25µM), sutherlandia extract (300µg/mL) resulted in elevated m-RNA expression levels and functional activity of CYP3A4 (human homologue of rodent CYP3A2) in LS-180 cells.

Diabetes is an important human ailment afflicting many from various walks of life in different countries. In India it is proving to be a major health problem, especially in the urban areas. Though there are various approaches to reduce the ill effects of diabetes and its secondary complications, herbal formulations are preferred due to lesser side effects and low cost. A list of medicinal plants with proven antidiabetic and related beneficial effects and of herbal drugs used in treatment of diabetes is compiled. These include, Allium sativum, Eugenia jambolana, Momordica charantia Ocimum sanctum, Phyllanthus amarus, Pterocarpus marsupium, Tinospora cordifolia, Trigonella foenum graecum and Withania somnifera. One of the etiologic factors implicated in the development of diabetes and its complications is the damage induced by free radicals and hence an antidiabetic compound with antioxidant properties would be more beneficial.

We present he case of a 55-year-old male who suffered a fatal breakthrough seizure, with no evidence of non-compliance with his anticonvulsant medications. The autopsy report revealed sub-therapeutic serum levels for both anticonvulsants Depakote | and Dilantin |. Concomitant with his prescribed medications, the decedent was also self-medicating with a cornucopia of herbal supplements and nutraceuticals, prominent among which was Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo, an herbal extract from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, has been used medicinally for centuries and has been touted as a cure for a variety of medical conditions. The induction of Cytochrome P450 enzymes by components of herbal drugs has been known to affect the metabolism of various drugs. Dilantin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9, and secondarily metabolized by CYP2C19. Valproate metabolism is also m dulated in part by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. A recent study revealed significant inductive effect of ginkgo on CYP2C19 activity. CYP2C19 induction by ginkgo could be a plausible explanation for the subtherapeutic levels of Dilantin and Depakote. Additionally, ginkgo nuts contain a potent neurotoxin, which is known to induce seizure activity. Evidence of other herbal drugs diminishing the efficacy of anticonvulsant medication does exist; however, there has been only one other documented instance of ginkgo potentiating seizure activity in the presence of anticonvulsant therapy. Highlighting the potential adverse effects and drug interactions of ginkgo on the packaging of the drug may help prevent inadvertent use in vulnerable individuals.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:00:57.592Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:00:57.592Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b5f96d7b5ad7298c901b","title":"RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Evaluation of the transporter-mediated herb-drug","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=E5BD42F15CD22D253C4EE782EA47149E?doi=10.1.1.812.3602&rank=38","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): interaction potential of DA-9801, a standardized","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:00:57.592Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:00:57.592Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b5f96d7b5ad7298c901d","title":"Pharmaceutical Research Effect of Pongamia Bark Extract on antihyperglycemic effect of glibenclamide for possible herb-drug interaction","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=E5BD42F15CD22D253C4EE782EA47149E?doi=10.1.1.1066.4213&rank=40","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda):  ABSTRACT Use of herbs or herbal medicines with prescription allopathic medicines may lead to beneficial or harmful herb-drug interaction, which needs a scientific substantiation.

The interaction was evaluated in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rats using the parameters such as glucose tolerance test, acute and sub-acute levels of antidiabetic study and body weight estimations at various intervals. Glibenclamide was administered orally at two different doses of 300 µg/kg (low dose) and 600 µg/kg (high dose) and PBME was co-administered at the dose of 200 mg/kg. Individual treatments of above drugs were also carried out. Significant (P<0.001) hypoglycemic effect was observed with the combination therapy of glibenclamide and PBME compared to their individual treatments in the above studied parameters. The combination therapy showed more percentage increase in body weight than the individual treatments. The study indicates that the present herb-drug interaction was beneficial as PBME showed synergistic effect with glibenclamide. This could provide an opportunity to reduce the dose of glibenclamide to achieve an enhanced therapeutic effect with minimal side effects.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:00:57.592Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:00:57.592Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b5f96d7b5ad7298c901c","title":"Research Article www.ijptonline.com HERBAL MEDICATION: HERB-DRUG INTERACTIONS AND PATIENT PSYCHOANALYSIS","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=E5BD42F15CD22D253C4EE782EA47149E?doi=10.1.1.248.4511&rank=39","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Many medicinal herbs and pharmaceutical drugs are therapeutic at one dose and toxic at another.

By its nature, anticoagulation increases the risk of bleeding; this risk is particularly high during transitions of care. Established anticoagulants are not ideal, due to requirements for parenteral administration, narrow therapeutic indices, and/or a need for frequent therapeutic monitoring. The development of effective oral anticoagulants that are administered as a fixed dose, have low potential for drug-drug and drug-food interactions, do not require regular anticoagulation monitoring, and are suitable for both inpatient and outpatient use is to be welcomed. Three new oral anticoagulants, the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate, and the factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, have been approved in the US for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation; rivaroxaban is also approved for prophylaxis and treatment of deep vein thrombosis, which may lead to pulmonary embolism in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery.

Various antidepressants, ranging from monoamine oxidase inhibitors to recently developed SSRIs or dual reuptake inhibitors, are prescribed for alleviating the symptoms of depression. Despite the availability of these blockbuster molecules, approximately 30 % of depressed patients do not respond to the existing drug therapies and the remaining 70 % fails to achieve complete remission. Moreover, antidepressants are associated with a plethora of side effects and drug-drug/drug-food interactions.

Exposure of cells and organisms to stressors might result in epigenetic changes. Here it is shown that investigation of DNA methylation using pyrosequencing is an alternative for in vitro and in vivo toxicological testing of epigenetic effects induced by chemicals and drugs. An in vitro evaluation of global and CpG site specific DNA methylation upon treatment of cells with chemicals/drugs is shown. Bisulfite genomic sequencing of methylation controls showed highmethylation of LINE1 in methylation positive control and low methylation in the negative controls. The CpG sites within the LINE1 element are methylated at different levels. In vitro cell cultures show a methylation level ranging from 56 % to 49%. Cultures of drug resistant tumor cells show significant hypomethylation as compared with the originating nonresistant tumor cells. The in vitro testing of epigenetically active chemicals (5-methyl-2’-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A) revealed a significant change of LINE1 methylation status upon treatment, while specific CpG sites were more prone to demethylation than others (focal methylation). In conclusion, DNA methylation using pyrosequencing might be used not only for testing epigenetic toxins/drugs but also in risk assessment of drugs, food, and environmental relevant pollutants. 1.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:02:18.366Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:02:18.366Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b6d16d7b5ad7298c9051","title":"US Food and Drug","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=4411DB9E02AA3A59C7A961F50F2660AE?doi=10.1.1.333.9308&rank=92","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Classification of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-metabolizing bacterium,","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:04:33.737Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:04:33.737Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b6d16d7b5ad7298c9050","title":"Food and Drug Administration (2012)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=4411DB9E02AA3A59C7A961F50F2660AE?doi=10.1.1.255.6426&rank=91","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): http://www.regulations.gov.

Central to ICE concept of safe and flexible plug-and-play interoperability is the notion of an ICE Device Model (DM), which is intended to be a machine-readable meta-data description of a device’s capabilities as exposed in standardized form over its network interface. In this paper, we present an overview of the stakehold-ers and high level goals of the ICE DM as necessary for supporting safe and flexible plug-and-play interoperability.

In this report, a highly immunogenic Mycobacterium kansasii protein (MK35) and the gene encoding this antigen were characterized. MK35 gene probes reacted with genomic DNA from M. avium, M. bovis BCG, M. intracellulare and M. tuberculosis but not with DNA isolated from nine other mycobacterial species. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the MK35 gene encodes a 26 kDa protein which contains a consensus bacterial lipoprotein processing sequence. In addition, detergent-phase separation studies strongly suggested that MK35 is a lipoprotein. Skin test assays demonstrated that MK35 elicited a strong response in guinea pigs sensitized with M. kansasii but did not react in M. tuberculosis-sensitized guinea pigs.

As a model to better understand how patterns of protein expression shape the tissue microenvironment, we analyzed protein expression in tissue derived from squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity through an antibody microarray approach for high-throughput proteomic analysis. Utilizing laser capture microdissection to procure total protein from specific microscopic cellular populations, we demonstrate that quantitative, and potentially qualitative, differences in expression patterns of multiple proteins within epithelial cells reproducibly correlate with oral cavity tumor progression. Furthermore, differential expression of multiple proteins was also found in stromal cells surrounding and adjacent to regions of diseased epi-thelium that directly correlated with tumor progression of the epithelium.

Two hundred and sixty-two compounds, including synthetic intermediates, pesticides, solvents, drugs, food components, natural products, and metabolites, are grouped by their structures. Some are in current use or are bioavailable while little exposure is expected from others. As more biologicresponse information is reported for small compounds of these types, it should become possible to select others for research on additional questions of structure-activity relationships. Some of the compounds are widespread while others are not. Some are used or found in large amounts while others may be trace contaminants, minor or more major by-products of synthesis or isolation. The pesticides and solvents, for example, are knowingly and often deliberately released to the environment, sometimes in very large quantities. Inadvertent release also occurs, sometimes referred to as fugitive emission. Food contaminants and drugs are directly accessible to humans. Sparsely distributed natural products could be accessible to humans, for example, via the food chain. Some of the compounds in food may be formed during preparation, storage or metabolically. Last, the haloethylene function has often been synthesized into compounds in order to achieve desired biologic activities. There are many types and degrees of relatedness of structure, depending upon atomic dimensions and stereochemical, polar, resonance, and other factors. Furthermore, for some chemical series, biologic responses are continuously variable while, in other cases, it is not uncommon that qualitatively different types of response occur with apparently very close homologs. Genetic, metabolic, and behavioral factors affecting response must also be considered. Thus, safety or hazard cannot yet be predicted conclusively by apparent relatedness of structure alone. Also, since the tables are noncomprehensive, some relevant compounds have likely been omitted.

Sensitivity to chemicals appears to be the consequence of a two-step process: loss of tolerance in susceptible persons following exposure to various toxicants, and subsequent triggering of symptoms by extremely small quantities of previously tolerated chemicals, drugs, foods, and food and drug combinations including caffeine and alcohol. Although chemical sensitivity may be the consequence of this process, a term that may more clearly describe the observed process is toxicant-induced loss of tolerance. Features of this yet-to-be-proven mechanism or theory of disease that affect the design of human exposure studies include the stimulatory and withdrawallike nature (resembling addiction) of symptoms reported by patients and masking. have Masking, which may blunt or eliminate responses to chemical challenges, appears to several components: apposition, which is the overlapping of the effects of closely timed exposures, acclimatization or habituation, and addiction. A number of human challenge studies in this area have concluded that there is no physiological basis for chemical sensitivity. However, these studies have failed to address the role of masking. To ensure reliable and reproducible responses to challenges, future studies in which subjects are evaluated in an environmental medical unit, a hospital-based facility in which background chemical exposures are reduced to the lowest levels practicable, may be necessary. A set of postulates is offered to determine whether there is a causal relationship between low-level chemical exposures and symptoms using an environmental medical unit.

Thus, in dogs, hyperthyroidism induced by thyroxin administra-tion is associated with an increased rate of excre-tion of a water load (Adolph, 1943). In humans, hypothyroidism is associated with an expansion of total body water and extracellular fluid (Elkin-ton and Danowski, 1955). In rats, hypothyroid-ism induced by surgical thyroidectomy is accom-panied by a decreased water intake compared to that of control rats (Fregly et at., 1960). It was therefore surprising to observe an increased water intake and urinary output in rats rendered hypo-thyroid by the antithyroid drug, propylthio-uradil. Following verification and extension of this initial observation to other antithyroid drugs, some objectives of this study were to determine whether the propylthiouradil-induced polydipsia was the result of either an altered thirst drive or an increased water loss or both. A further objective was to determine whether an increase in water intake of hypophysectomized rats could be produced by antithyroid drugs. METHODS m RESULTS. The first three experi-ments were performed to determine whether administration of the antithyroid drugs, thio-uracil and methimazole, was accompanied by increased water intake. The first experiment used 10 male Holtzman rats weighing initially from 180 to 200g.

This investigation tests a model that incorporates and explains both domain-specific and domain-general differences in impulsive behavior. Specifically, the model predicts that within-individual variation across domains is explained by subjective domain-specific appraisals of temptation and perceived harm, whereas domain-general impulsivity is explained by domain-general self-control strategies (e.g., pre-commitment) and resources (e.g., working memory).

Because the supercritical phase represents a state in which liquid and gas properties converge, supercritical fluid chromatography is sometimes called \"convergence chromatography.\" Supercritical fluid chromatography is one of the most important column chromatography methods after gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Supercritical fluids combine useful properties of gas and liquid phases. The characteristic properties of a supercritical fluid are density, diffusivity and viscosity.SFC, the sample is carried through a separating column by a supercritical fluid where the mixture is divided into unique bands based on the amount of interaction between the individual analytes and the stationary phase in the column. As these bands leave the column, their identities and quantities are determined by a detector SFC is a hybrid of gas and liquid chromatography because when the mobile phase is below its critical temperature and above its critical pressure, it acts as a liquid, so the technique is liquid chromatography (LC) and when the mobile phase is above its critical temperature and below its critical pressure, The instrumentation that is required for supercritical fluid chromatography is versatile because of its multi-detector compatibility.SFC has been applied to wide variety of materials including natural products, drugs, foods, pesticides, herbicides, surfactants, polymers and polymer additives, fossils fuels, petroleum, explosives and propellants.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:06:39.663Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:06:39.663Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b74f6d7b5ad7298c909c","title":"Food Safety Bureau, Korea Food and Drug","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=E84524A4B68F8004D2649F1E74F0E1F8?doi=10.1.1.775.7129&rank=169","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:06:39.663Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:06:39.663Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b74f6d7b5ad7298c909b","title":"C: Warfarin-cranberry juice interaction","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=E84524A4B68F8004D2649F1E74F0E1F8?doi=10.1.1.963.4418&rank=168","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Warfarin’s antithrombotic effect maybe influenced by a variety of fac-tors, such as drug, food, herbal product, and disease state interactions, as well as patient adherence.1,2 There have been several case reports of cranberry juice or cranberry sauce potentiating the effects of warfarin by elevating the INR.3-8 Cranberry juice is a commonly con-sumed beverage that may also be used by patients for self-treatment in the pre-vention or adjunctive treatment of uri-nary tract infections.9 We report a case that describes repeat-ed international normalized ratio (INR) elevations of 4.6 and 6.5 in a patient pre-viously stable on warfarin after ingestion of 1420-1893 mL of cranberry juice cocktail daily for several days.

Contrary to the U.S.A., where greatest achievements were accomplished in the field of marketing theory and application and its implementation into veterinary practice, as well as in appropriate perception of importance of marketing idea and philosophy, this issue has not been appropriately addressed in our country. The main goal of marketing in veterinary practice is not only to sell a product or service, but also to create mutual profitable long-term relations with clients. Disregarding personal reasons for practicing veterinary medicine, particularly in small-animal practice, the veterinarian should approach such practice as any other business activity that should provide profits. In that respect, it is of key importance to adopt marketing approach and management concept. The four basic marketing instruments are product, price, promotion and place that make so-called marketing mix, which is applicable also in the veterinary practice. In veterinary medicine, the product pertains to spent items (e.g. drugs, food) or veterinary services. By determining the price, the basis is the cost price and added profit margin, depending on the product or service offered. The promotion encompasses communication with the owners, presenting them products and services offered, describing the features of the clinic or infirmary, etc. Contrary to other business branches, position of veterinary unit is not so important, yet it must provide good communication with animal owner. The overall experience of the customer, starting from entering the clinic / infirmary until leaving it, must be professional, pleasant and effective. Only accomplishing this goal will enable competitiveness or justify even a higher price for a superior service.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:06:53.567Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:06:53.567Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b75d6d7b5ad7298c90a1","title":"Inorganic Particle Content of Foods and Drugs","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C8DBA034209495150F936BDFFAA551BC?doi=10.1.1.276.3504&rank=174","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Inorganic particulate matter in foods and drugs is discussed from the standpoint of determination by optical microscopy, source, and regulatory significance.

According to a recent study, the number of these consumer protection class actions brought in federal court climbed from 19 cases in 2008 to more than 102 in 2012.1 The majority of these cases have been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, now referred to as the “Food Court. ” This surge in lawsuit filings has led some legal commentators to suggest that “food is replacing tobacco as the new regulatory and class action target.”2 This “unprecedented surge”3 of deceptive labeling and advertising lawsuits against the makers of products such as Naked Juice, Fruit Roll-Ups, Bear Naked Granola, and Wesson Oil, reveals a trend of regulation by litigation—that is, a turning over of food labeling issues to the courts in light of a lax regulatory system. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is charged with regulating food labeling, plaintiffs ’ attorneys are seeking to fill a void in the FDA’s regulatory authority and enforcement of food labeling laws. This paper provides an overview of the recent food labeling litigation and explores the reasons for this flood of litigation. However, this paper does not evaluate the merits of the lawsuits.

Seafood consumption was initially modeled using short-term (3 day) U.S. consumption surveys that recorded the amount of fish eaten per meal. Since longer exposure periods include more eaters with a lower daily mean intake, the consumption distribution was adjusted by broadening the distribution to include more eaters and reducing the distribution mean to keep total population intake constant. The estimate for the total number of eaters was based on long-term purchase diaries. Levels of mercury in canned tuna, swordfish, and shark were based on FDA survey data. The distribution of mercury levels in other species was based on reported mean levels, with the frequency of consumption of each species based on market share. The shape distribution for the given mean was based on the range of variation encountered among shark, tuna, and swordfish.

To assess the safety profile of H1N1 vaccines in the United States, CDC reviewed vaccine safety results for the H1N1 vaccines from 3,783 reports received through the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and electronic data from 438,376 persons vaccinated in managed-care organizations in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), a large, population-based database with administrative and diagnostic data, in the first 2 months of reporting (as of November 24). VAERS data indicated 82 adverse event reports per 1 million H1N1 vaccine doses distributed, compared with 47 reports per 1 million seasonal influenza vaccine doses distributed. However, no substantial differences between H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccines were noted in the proportion or types of serious adverse events reported. No increase in any adverse events under surveillance has been seen in VSD data. Many agencies are using multiple systems to monitor H1N1 vaccine safety (2). Health-care providers and the public are encouraged to report adverse health events that occur after vaccination. Reports to VAERS Health-care providers and manufacturers are required to report to VAERS certain adverse events in vaccinees brought to their attention after vaccination with licensed U.S. vaccines;*","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:07:37.516Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:07:37.516Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b7896d7b5ad7298c90c1","title":"Ying Yang, US Food and Drug (2013)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=B5A9F633D718558EB5A7A71300C24FC2?doi=10.1.1.772.8023&rank=206","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2013.00043 The effects of a pilot intervention for community-dwelling adults with rheumatoid arthritis inWuhan, China","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:07:37.516Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:07:37.516Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b7896d7b5ad7298c90c3","title":"National Institute of Food and Drug Safety","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=B5A9F633D718558EB5A7A71300C24FC2?doi=10.1.1.784.9522&rank=208","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): open access to scientific and medical research","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:07:37.516Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:07:37.516Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b7896d7b5ad7298c90c2","title":"Nutrition, U.

The entire set of proteins from this pathogen and the ones encoded in human genome were determined. Pyruvate kinase involved in carbohydrate metabolic pathway of S.pyogenes was chosen based on gene expression as a potential drug target candidate.

In 2004, the abscess finally broke. First came the rec-ognition that widely used antidepressants were associated with suicide in young pa-tients, and then came the withdrawal of Vioxx. Drugs in diabetes and metabolism have not been spared. The obesity drug Meridia and the lipid-lowering agent Crestor are two of the five drugs whose safety was challenged by FDA epidemiol-ogist Dr. David Graham in testimony be-fore a Senate committee (3). Unique among drug withdrawals is the diabetes drug phenformin, which was declared an imminent hazard by Secre-tary Califano and was removed from the market in 1977 because of lactic acidosis (4). As was the case with Vioxx, more recent withdrawals of diabetes and me-tabolism drugs were done by the manu-facturers. The obesity drug Redux was removed in 1997 because of heart valvu-lopathy (5). The diabetes drug Rezulin was removed in 2000 because of liver fail-ure and the lipid-lowering drug Baycol in 2001 because of rhabdomyolysis (6). But the news for diabetes drugs has not been all bad. The concern about lactic acidosis that accompanied the approval of Glucophage has been found to be greatly exaggerated (7). Despite reports of liver injury that appeared shortly after the ap-proval of Avandia, there is little, if any, evidence that either Avandia or the re-lated drug Actos increase the risk of liver injury over background (8). One lesson that should be learned from these examples is that it is hazardous to make firm conclusions about the safety of a new drug. The approval of a new drug is based on safety data from a few thou-sand patients treated under the intense medical supervision of a clinical trial. The very patients who are likely to have side effects are often excluded from these tri-als. Therefore, no one should be surprised that additional problems may be uncov-ered when millions of unselected patients are treated under real-world conditions. The purpose of this article is to de-scribe the process by which FDA evalu-ates safety data and to provide examples that illustrate how problems have been handled.

Descriptive analyses were con-ducted on the survey responses. Results: Three hundred sixty-four respondents (34%) completed the online survey. The majority were primary care prescribers (65%) versus nonprimary prescribers. The majority of primary care, oncologist, and specialist pre-scribers responded that REMS was meaningful, improved patient safety, and made an impact on their patient interactions. The majority of surgeons and pain management prescribers responded that REMS was not meaningful, did not improve safety for the patients, or did not impact their interactions with their patients. Over 50 % of prescribers counseled their patients or had another health care team member discuss the risks and benefits of these REMS-related medications; medication guides or other printed literature was not provided as much. Conclusion: The results from the survey suggest that prescriber specialty has an impact on the perceived value of the REMS program and the perceived need to counsel patients regarding medications with REMS programs.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:08:51.642Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:08:51.642Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b7d36d7b5ad7298c90f7","title":"OVERVIEW OF THE USE OF FOOD/NATURAL PRODUCTS AS DRUGS","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=11B7A7B0D5BCF332BA0FAC7A65C27A7D?doi=10.1.1.900.3127&rank=260","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Higher plants produce numerous extractable organic substances which are in great demand throughout the world.

This review aims to assess the current status of research with medicinal herbs and their phytochemicals for the development of antiangiogenic agents for cancer and other angiogenesis-related diseases including infl amma-tion, diabetic retinopathy, endometriosis and obesity. Most studies reviewed have focused on vascular endothe-lial growth factor (VEGF)/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) signaling for endothelial response processes and have led to the identifi cation of many potential antiangiogenic agents. Since human clinical trials with antiangiogenic modalities targeting VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling have shown limited effi cacy and occasional toxic side effects, screening strategies for herbal phytochemicals based on other signaling path-ways important for cancer-endothelial and stromal crosstalks should be emphasized in the future.

The purpose of this study was to systematically review the clinical literature on herbal medicine and lactation. Methods: The databases PubMed, CAB Abstracts, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, HealthSTAR, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Reprotox were systematically searched for human trials from 1970 until 2010. Reference lists from relevant articles were hand-searched. Results: Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Clinical studies were divided into three categories: survey studies (n = 11), safety studies (n = 8), and efficacy studies (n = 13). Six studies were randomized controlled trials. The most common herbs studied were St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) (n = 3), garlic (Allium sativum L.) extract (n = 2), and senna (Cassia senna L.) (n = 2). Studies were very heterogeneous with regard to study design, herbal intervention, and outcome measures. Overall, poor methodological quality predominated among the studies. Conclusions: Our review concludes that further research is needed to assess the prevalence, efficacy, and safety of commonly used herbs during breastfeeding.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:10:31.868Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:10:31.868Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b8376d7b5ad7298c910f","title":"Chinese Herbs in Disease (2012)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=BBB306ABD75BEFF36844F5B3B9D41348?doi=10.1.1.459.9074&rank=15","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Copyright © 2012 Li-Ling Lin et al.

As yield and quality data of broad-leaf grassland species are scarce, the aim of this study was to obtain novel information on vitamins in a number of herb species compared to a grass-clover mixture and to get insight into species differences and seasonal patterns across the various harvests and years. Seven herb species and a perennial ryegrasswhite clover mixture were investigated in a cutting trial with four harvests (May-Oct) during 2009 and 2010. Vitamin concentrations were highest in October. The α-tocopherol concentrations were lowest in lucerne and yellow sweet clover, and highest in salad burnet and plantain. The β-carotene concentrations were lowest in lucerne, salad burnet and yellow sweet clover and highest in caraway, birdsfoot trefoil and plantain.

There are various factors by which we can control the obesity by limiting energy intake and increasing the energy expenditure. Obesity therapies include reducing nutrient absorption and applying anorectic drugs, thermogenic drugs or drug that effect lipid mobilization and utilization. Success rate of obesity therapies are very low because most obese persons will not lose weight and of those who loses weight most of them regain it due to the adverse effect associated with these anti obesity drugs.

Marlborough region. Aspects of its ecology were studied to assist in the management of wild populations. An absolute estimate of abundance is not possible as individual Scutellaria plants are indistinguishable and it grows in small patches up to 20 m2. There are probably between 50 and 100 such patches in podocarp-beech forest below 200 m a.s.1. on freely drained alluvium and colluvium. The vigour of Scutellaria patches as estimated from changes in shoot frequency and seed production varies widely depending on site conditions. It cannot tolerate competition from ferns, herbs, weeds, and shrub growth which occurs once the ground surface stabilises. Patches of Scutellaria have a marked seasonal variation in mean height, reaching a peak of approximately 12-15 cm during flowering (November-December), and then declining. Fresh Scutellaria seeds take several weeks to germinate and many enter the soil seed bank. Seedlings rarely appeared in bare ground plots at the field sites, but many emerged rapidly from topsoil samples placed in a glasshouse, along with abundant seedlings of vigorous adventive weeds. Scutellaria patches expand mainly by vegetative means. Scutellaria has been reduced in abundance by grazing at some sites, yet at others it has probably benefitted from grazing through the removal of competition from other plants, including adventive weeds. The implications of the results for the conservation of Scutellaria are mentioned.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:10:46.804Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:10:46.804Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b8466d7b5ad7298c9116","title":"Dioscorides’ Etruscan Herbs","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=BE29C81A0CBB9B0AFAE6E3D38609F360?doi=10.1.1.730.7010&rank=22","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): makes some interesting points regarding the manuscript traditions that include alternative names for the plants and herbs in Dioscorides’ Materia medica.1 It was beyond the scope of Johnson’s brief introductory note, however, and hence it is the goal of this article, to sug-gest how and why these synonyms, not included by Dioscorides in his original work,2 enter the manuscript history, and more impor-tantly, why these names might indicate a par-ticularly Etruscan herbalism.

The distribution of many woodland herbs extends 1000–2000 km in a north– south direction, yet the majority of these species grow clonally, have little recruitment by seed, and possess no obvious mechanism for long-distance seed dispersal. Although aware that woodland herbs disperse poorly, ecologists have tacitly assumed that, given long periods of time, even small dispersal distances would allow woodland herbs to colonize the vast geographic region they now occupy. We examined this assumption for the understory herb Asarum canadense. To estimate long-term rates of spread by seed, we calibrated seed-dispersal diffusion models with life history data and with data on seed carries by ants. We supplemented our field observations and modeling results for A. canadense with a literature survey on the dispersal capabilities of other plant species. Ants transported A. canadense seeds up to 35 m, the largest distance ants are known to move the seeds of any woodland herb. Empirically calibrated diffusion models indicated that over the last 16 000 yr A. canadense should only have traveled 10–11 km from its glacial refugia. In actuality, A. canadense moved hundreds of kilometers during this time.

Investigations were performed as a series of controlled single-factor experiments. The basic target functions of the study were as follows: drive's absorbed power of the machine (kW); specific energy consumption (kWh/t) and average cutting length (mm). The levels of controlled trial factors were as follows: machine load capacity with herb stem mass: Q = 0.5; 1 and 1.5 kg/s and feeding velocity of stem mass to the cutting drum: V = 2.0; 2.4 and 2.8 m/s. Here are the factors, maintained at stable levels: cutting drum peripheral velocity -25 m/s at rotation frequency of 1176 min -1 ; cutting drum working width -Β=0.558 mm; cutting drum diameter D=0.406 m; number of blades z=6; blade thickness b=10 mm; blade sharpening angle β=34°; inclination of blades' edges to the counteredge α=15°; front cutting angle ϕ=50°; gap between blade and counterblade edges ∆=0.5 mm; sharpening angle of the counterblade β 1 =90° and sharpness of counterblade cutting edge δ=0.2 mm. The correlation between the variation of drive's absorbed power for startup of the cutting drum, specific energy consumption and average cutting length, on the one hand, and the variation of controlled factors, on the other, was established.

As such, we suggest that allogrooming is the predominant premating mechanism in this species. Key words: allogrooming, Apodemus microps, cooperation, programmed grooming, reciprocity.

The fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5), with a 2.2-km horizontal grid spacing, successfully simulates the mesoscale rainfall distribution associated with Herb, and the predicted max-imum 24-h rainfall of 1199 mm accounts for about 70 % of the observed amount of 1736 mm at Mount A-Li. It is shown that, with an accurate track simulation, the ability of the model to simulate successfully the observed rainfall is dependent on two factors: the model’s horizontal grid spacing and its ability to describe the Taiwan terrain. The existence of the Central Mountain Range has only a minor impact on the storm track, but it plays a key role in substantially increasing the total rainfall amounts over Taiwan. The analysis presented here shows that the model and terrain resolutions play a nearly equivalent role in the heavy precipitation over Mount A-Li. The presence of maximum vertical motion and heating rate in the lower troposphere, above the upslope mountainous region, is a significant feature of forced lifting associated with the interaction of the typhoon’s circulation and Taiwan’s mountainous terrain.

Assuming unlimited and no migration, respectively, our model predicts that 1% or 5-9% of European mammals risk extinction, while 32-46% or 70-78% may be severely threatened (lose > 30% of their current distribution) under the two scenarios.

However, it frequently is forgotten that even in an extract several active ingredients contribute to the pharmacological action. Sufficient evidence exists to suggest that extracts of medicinal herbs, once isolated in their pure state, can produce pharmacological effects that differ significantly from that of the whole herb.

The following paper will review literature pertinent to herbal supplementation in horses as well as other species. Common equine supplements like, echinacea, garlic, ginger, ginseng, and yucca among many others, are not regulated and few studies have investigated a safe yet effective dose of these compounds. Ginseng is commonly studied and has been found to exert an inhibitory effect on IL-1β and IL-6 gene expression, decrease TNF-α production by macrophages, decrease cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and suppress histamine and leukotriene release. On-going studies in horses are testing the anti-inflammatory effects of a single dose of ginger, postexercise. Echinacea, a common immunostimulant, or 'cold fighter', has been reported to have an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Equine studies found that garlic fed at > 0.2 g kg -1 d -1 developed Heinz body anaemia. Yucca contains steroid-like saponins, which produce an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-spasmodic effect to reduce pain associated with arthritis. Herbs can have a drug-like action that can interact with other components in the horses' diet. Some herbs contain prohibited substances like salicylates, digitalis, heroin, cocaine and marijuana. Drug-herb interactions are also common side effects and caution needs to be taken when determining which 'natural product' to use. Few herbs have had sufficient research to warrant concrete recommendations for efficacy and dosage in equines.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:12:32.222Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:12:32.222Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b8b06d7b5ad7298c9157","title":"195 ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS OF SPICES AND HERBS ESSENTIAL OILS","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=830D5BF21DD07E54634A1CD89A30CA34?doi=10.1.1.822.1730&rank=88","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Spices and herbs have been used as food additives since ancient times, as flavouring agents but also as natural food preservatives.

Depression is a recurrent, common, and potentially life-threatening psychiatric disease related to multiple assignable causes. Although conventional antidepressant therapy can help relieve symptoms of depression and prevent relapse of the illness, complementary therapies are required due to disadvantage of the current therapy such as adverse effects. Moreover, a number of studies have researched adjunctive therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes for depression patients. Purpose. One potential complementary method with conventional antidepressants involves the use of medicinal herbs and phytochemicals that provide therapeutic benefits. Studies have revealed beneficial effects of medical herbs and phytochemicals on depression and their central nervous system mechanism. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of the therapeutic benefits of phytochemicals and medicinal herbs against depression and describe their detailed mechanisms. Sections. There are two sections, phytochemicals against depression and medical herbs against depression, in this review. Conclusion. Use of phytomedicine may be an alternative option for the treatment of depression in case conventional drugs are not applicable due to their side effects, low effectiveness, or inaccessibility. However, the efficacy and safety of these phytomedicine treatments for depression have to be supported by clinical studies.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:12:32.222Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:12:32.222Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b8c16d7b5ad7298c915a","title":"A REVIEW ON ANTI -ULCER HERBS IN SIDDHA MEDICINE (2013)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=078840C7C0C2CCC1F5473466D8ABD1E2?doi=10.1.1.1043.138&rank=91","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda):  Abstract: Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is the most common and serious gastrointestinal disorder on clinical practice.

Forty-one 10 x10 m plots were established under the closed canopy (18 plots), small and medium canopy gaps (11) and large canopy gaps dominated by Guadua tagoara (Ness) Kunth (12). Inside each plot, the line intercept method was applied to assess soil coverage as an estimate of density of herb stratum vegetation. Hemispherical photographs were taken at the centre of the plots to evaluate the annual light regime. Overall, Calathea communis Wanderley and S. Vieira had the greater mean coverage, followed by woody seedlings, ground ferns and other herbs (mainly, Araceae, Acanthaceae, Amaranthaceae and Cyperaceae). There were strong correlations among several groups of the herb stratum, such as the negative correlations between woody seedlings with the coverage of C. communis and with rocks. The analysis of the hemispherical photographs confirmed the difference among environments that led to significant differences in the soil coverage of the herb stratum vegetation but woody seedlings. For instance, C. communis showed great coverage in large gaps while ferns were more abundant in small and medium gaps and in the understorey. Other herbs, in turn, demonstrated bigger soil coverage in small and medium gaps. Although this study represents a rough assessment of the structure and composition of the herb stratum, the results found here illustrated the evident relation between herb species density and the environmental variation promoted by changes on canopy structure and topography.

Estrutura do estrato herbáceo sob diferentes regimes de luz na Floresta Pluvial Atlântica Submontana Resumo O objetivo deste estudo foi caracterizar a estrutura do estrato herbáceo em relação à disponibilidade de luz na Floresta Pluvial Atlântica Submontana do Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho, SP, Brasil. Para tanto, foram instaladas 41 parcelas de 10 x 10 m em ambientes sob o dossel fechado (18 parcelas), em clareiras pequenas e médias (11), e em clareiras grandes com dominância de Guadua tagoara (Ness) Kunth (12). Em cada parcela a percentagem de cobertura de solo, avaliada através do método de interceptação em linha, foi usada como estimativa da densidade da vegetação do estrato herbáceo. Fotografias hemisféricas foram tomadas ao centro de cada uma das parcelas para avaliar o regime anual de luz nos ambientes. No geral, a maior média obtida foi para Calathea communis Wanderley e S. Vieira, seguida por plântulas de regenerantes lenhosos, pteridófitas terrestres e outras ervas (principalmente Araceae, Acanthaceae, Amaranthaceae e Cyperaceae). Houve ainda fortes correlações entre vários grupos do estrato herbáceo, como as correlações negativas entre plântulas de regenerantes com a cobertura de C. communis e de rochas. A análise das fotografias hemisféricas confirmou a existência de ambientes com diferentes regimes de luz, que promoveram diferenças significativas na cobertura do solo de todos os grupos do estrato herbáceo, exceto para plântulas de regenerantes. Por exemplo, C. communis apresentou grande cobertura nas grandes clareiras, enquanto que as pteridófitas terrestres foram mais abundantes no sub-bosque e nas clareiras pequenas e médias. O grupo Outras Ervas, por sua vez, apresentou maiores coberturas nas clareiras pequenas e médias. Apesar de representar uma análise grosseira da estrutura e composição, os resultados encontrados aqui ilustraram uma evidente relação entre a densidade de formas de vida herbácea e as variações ambientais promovidas por mudanças na estrutura do dossel da floresta e na topografia.

Darrin, pers. commun.). Evidence of growth in the practice of Chinese medicine is probably best illustrated by the increase in number of licensed Chinese medicine providers in the US, from 5,525 in 1992, to 14,228 today (B. Mitchell, pers. commun.). This increase in traditional Chinese medicine practitioners has increased the demand for medicinal plant material. Yet, practically all of the plant material (cultivated or wildcrafted) used in the practice of traditional Chinese medicine in the US is imported from China (P. Darrin, pers. commun.). Since many of the imported Chinese medicinal plant species are produced in environments similar to environments in the US, the possibility of domestic production of these plants for the US Chinese medicinal market exists. Domestic production of these botanicals would help insure the safety, freshness, and quality of the material. Although the earliest practitioners of Chinese medicine in the US (many of whom were medical doctors) tended to use only acupuncture, Westerners have come to understand that dietary therapy, including the use of herbs and other botanicals, is central to traditional Chinese medicine. In addition, the practice of traditional Chinese medicine is based on a philosophy (holistic) quite different than the practice of “Western ” medicine","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:13:38.525Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:13:38.525Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b8f26d7b5ad7298c9170","title":"on Prime Numbers","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=0F0DEC24413327E7F183B78B9B02DE92?doi=10.1.1.731.6883&rank=114","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Herbs for health","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:13:38.525Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:13:38.525Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b8f26d7b5ad7298c9172","title":"WESTERN RESERVE HERB SOCIETY A Unit of The Herb Society of America SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION (2014-2015) Western Reserve Herb Society Scholarship $5,000 (2014)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=0F0DEC24413327E7F183B78B9B02DE92?doi=10.1.1.658.4769&rank=117","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): You must be an OHIO RESIDENT and have completed 1 YEAR OF COLLEGE to be eligible.

Although technologies including DNA barcoding have been introduced to help address this problem, they are generally time-consuming and require expensive sequencing. Herein, we present a simple sequencing-free electrochemical biosensor, which enables easy differentiation between two closely related Fritillaria species. To improve its differentiation capability using trace amounts of DNA sample available from herbal extracts, a stepwise electrochemical deposition of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was adopted to engineer a synergistic nanostructured sensing interface. By using such a nanofeatured electrochemical DNA (E-DNA) biosensor, two Chinese herbal species of Fritillaria (F. thunbergii and F. cirrhosa) were successfully discriminated at the DNA level, because a fragment of 16-mer sequence at the spacer region of the 5S-rRNA only exists in F. thunbergii. This E-DNA sensor was capable of identifying the target sequence in the range from 100 fM to 10 nM, and a detection limit as low as 11.7 fM (S/N = 3) was obtained. Importantly, this sensor was applied to detect the unique fragment of the PCR products amplified from F. thunbergii and F. cirrhosa, respectively. We anticipate that such a direct, sequencing-free sensing mode will ultimately pave the way towards a new generation of herb-identification strategies.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:13:38.525Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:13:38.525Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b8f26d7b5ad7298c9174","title":"Indian Herbs and Herbal Drugs Used for the Treatment of Diabetes (2006)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=0F0DEC24413327E7F183B78B9B02DE92?doi=10.1.1.283.5584&rank=120","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Summary Traditional Medicines derived from medicinal plants are used by about 60 % of the world’s population. This review focuses on Indian Herbal drugs and plants used in the treatment of diabetes, especially in India. Diabetes is an important human ailment afflicting many from various walks of life in different countries. In India it is proving to be a major health problem, especially in the urban areas. Though there are various approaches to reduce the ill effects of diabetes and its secondary complications, herbal formulations are preferred due to lesser side effects and low cost. A list of medicinal plants with proven antidiabetic and related beneficial effects and of herbal drugs used in treatment of diabetes is compiled. These include, Allium sativum, Eugenia jambolana, Momordica charantia Ocimum sanctum, Phyllanthus amarus, Pterocarpus marsupium, Tinospora cordifolia, Trigonella foenum graecum and Withania somnifera. One of the etiologic factors implicated in the development of diabetes and its complications is the damage induced by free radicals and hence an antidiabetic compound with antioxidant properties would be more beneficial.

The outcome of our economic recovery may rest on the ability of individuals to create jobs in the small business sector. If you look at the statistics survival rate, safety programs for small business are abysmal. The state of their safety programs may be why so many smaller businesses fail. State after state tracks the safety records of small business vs. large business, and in all cases, the injury rates are far higher in the small business sector. Small business is an area rarely seen by safety people. Most safety professionals have never worked for or with a small business. The reason is the owners of these businesses feel they do not have the resources for mandated safety programs, and they fear the consequences of noncompliance. Most small business owners want to have a safe workplace but do not know how nor do they feel that they have the time or resources to develop a legal and comprehensive safety program. They know that they can contact OSHA for assistance, but they fear the consequences of having a state regulator in their shop. Most have been told that their insurance company may have resources to assist them, but they fear that their insurance rates may go up after the “insurance guy” inspects their business. Most business owners know that professional safety consultants can help them, but the owners feel they cannot afford to hire a consultant and do not have the time or resources to follow up on the consultant’s recommendations.

In the 20th century, influenza was pandemic several times and new diseases such as Lyme disease, Legionnaire’s disease, toxic-shock syndrome, hepatitis C, hepatitis E, and hantavirus were encountered. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is the etiologic agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), was identified in 1981 and now causes over 3 million deaths per year in the world. Drug and antibiotic resistance have become serious issues for diseases such as tuber-culosis, malaria, and gonorrhea. Prions have been identified as the infectious agents for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad-cow disease), Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, kuru, and scrapie in sheep. Changing patterns of social behavior and travel present new classes of disease transmission problems. For example, West Nile virus has spread to North America. Biological terrorism with diseases such as smallpox or plague has become a new threat.

We used correlation analysis, multiple regression, and nonparametric models to explore the relationships between overstory characteristics (canopy cover, stand density, and tree-size distributions) and the abundance of species in the herb and shrub layers in mature forests of western Washington. Overstory variables explained>50 % of the varia-tion in the mean response of total shrub cover and ca. 50 % of the variation in cover of Acer circinatum Pursh (the most common shrub species) and late-seral herbs (species reaching their greatest abundance in late-successional for-ests). Stronger relationships (80–90 % variance explained) were found between overstory variables and the maximum cover of total shrubs, A. circinatum, total herbs, and each of three functional groups of herbaceous species. These em-pirical relationships represent both direct resource limitations and time-dependent responses for which overstory charac-teristics may be surrogates. Models of maximum abundance yielded the most consistent results, suggesting the relative importance of different overstory variables as limiting factors for understory response, although these limiting factors have different effects on plants with different life-history strategies.

Modern medicine is rooted in ethnobotanical tra-ditions using indigenous flora to treat symptoms of human dis-eases or to improve specific aspects of the body condition. Herbal medicine is now used by over half of the American population. Yet the American medical community generally lacks knowledge of the function, metabolism, interaction, adverse reactions, and preparation of herbal products. OBJECTIVE. Because over 60 botanicals are marketed in cosme-ceutical formulations, dermatologists need to obtain working knowledge of the major botanicals. The preparation, traditional uses, mechanisms of action, human clinical data, adverse reac-tions, and interactions all impact herbal efficacy and are dis-cussed below. METHOD. English-language medical journal and symposium searches. RESULTS. The most important botanicals pertaining to dermato-logic uses, such as cosmeceuticals, include teas, soy, pomegran-ate, date, grape seed, Pycnogenol, horse chestnut, German chamomile, curcumin, comfrey, allantoin, and aloe. All are doc-umented to treat dermatologic conditions. Only green and black tea, soy, pomegranate, and date have published clinical trials for the treatment of parameters of extrinsic aging. CONCLUSIONS. Preparation of botanical-based cosmeceuticals is complex. Very few of these products are supported by evidence-based science.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:15:33.190Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:15:33.190Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b9656d7b5ad7298c91a2","title":"Antioxidative properties of water extracts obtained from herbs of the species","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=EECE505F926F20B6C4664A25A385863B?doi=10.1.1.518.2696&rank=170","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Essential oils and extracts of aromatic herbs obtained by organic solvents have been extensively studied for their antioxidant activity in lipid substrates.

In this work water extracts of six different herbs of the Lamiaceae family (dittany, lemon balm, mint, sage, sideritis and sweet marjoram) were prepared. The extracts were examined for their effect against lipid oxidation in comparison to a tea water extract. Sweet marjoram, sage and dittany extracts were found to have a remarkable capacity in retarding lipid oxidation. Examination by thin-layer chromatography of the freeze-dried extracts, before and after hydrolysis, showed that the extracts were rich in bound forms of phenolic compounds such as hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids. Rosmarinic and caffeic acids were detected in all extracts with the exception of those from mint and sideritis. These results indicate that certain plants used for the preparation of infusions could be further studied like tea as sources of antioxidants.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:15:33.190Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:15:33.190Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b9656d7b5ad7298c91a1","title":"Pesticide residues in some herbs growing in agricultural areas in Poland (2015)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=EECE505F926F20B6C4664A25A385863B?doi=10.1.1.809.6297&rank=169","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): content of plant protection products in selected herbs:","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:15:33.190Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:15:33.190Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b9716d7b5ad7298c91a3","title":"Systematic review of herbs and dietary supplements for glycemic control in diabetes.

In the mid-1990s, a debate began over whether understory herb communities recover to their pre-disturbance states following logging. Studies showing reduced herb-layer diversity in previously logged forests were criticized for not accounting for intersite environmental heterogeneity. More recent studies have addressed environmental heterogeneity, but have neglected long-term recovery by using \"mature forests\" as young as 80 years old as the benchmark for diversity comparison, even though old growth stands have disturbance return intervals exceeding 500 years. Here we address concerns clouding previous studies of high-diversity Appalachian herb communities and investigate their long-term recovery by comparing paired sites of old growth forest and forest logged 100-150 years ago. We found that species richness and individual abundance is greater in old growth forests than mature forests and that species composition differed significantly between the two. Turnover in species among old growth and mature forests accounted for 11% of the total species richness and was significantly greater than expected. Species turnover at intermediate (5-50 m) and landscape-scales (>10 km) contributed the most towards total species richness. Herb communities in rich cove forests have successional trajectories that exceed 150 years, with important community changes still occurring long after the forest returns to what has been previously termed a \"mature\" state. To conserve the diverse herb layer, we conclude that mature forest stands are too young to serve as baselines for recovery, landscapescale preservation of multiple forest stands is needed to maximize species richness, and maintaining 100-150-year logging rotations will likely lead to loss of biodiversity.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:15:45.432Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:15:45.432Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b9716d7b5ad7298c91a7","title":"ORIGINAL ARTICLE The Research on Herb and Its Allocation Form in Landscape","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=0FBAB07F16A3BF4883806D449B0D3CD0?doi=10.1.1.839.9286&rank=175","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): In order to provide a scientific foundation for herb application in landscape, the photographs were taken from the herb landscape in urban green space and sightseeing garden.

The popular cultivars for the fresh market and garden have dark green leaves and white flowers, with a rich spicy pungent aroma due to the presence of linalool/ methylchavicol/1,8-cineole. Lesser known cultivars vary in growth habit, size, and color, and can contain a wide range of aromas including, lemon, rose, camphor, licorice, woody, and fruity. The popularity of basil has led to an infusion of many introductions into the marketplace. For example, new cultivars, both All-American selections, include the new fusarium resistant lemon basil, ‘Sweet Dani’, a tall (65–70 cm), up-right plant with an intense lemon aroma (Morales and Simon 1997) and ‘Siam Queen’, an attractive plant with purple flowers on a dense dark green foliage.

Among thirty-eight herbs, Cannabis, Chamomile, Cranberry, Garlic, Ginkgo, Grapefruit, Lycium, Red clover, and St. John’s wort were evaluated to have major severity interaction with warfarin.

Most of existing studies focused on the specific prescription patterns for diverse diseases or syndromes, while little attention was paid to the common patterns, which reflect the global view of the regularities of prescriptions. In this paper, we designed a method CPPM to find the common prescription patterns. The CPPM is based on the hierarchical clustering of herb-pair efficacies (HPEs). Firstly, HPEs were hierarchically clustered; secondly, the individual herbs are labeled by the HPEC (the clusters of HPEs); and then the prescription patterns were extracted from the combinations of HPEC; finally the common patterns are recognized statistically. The results showed that HPEs have hierarchical clustering structure. When the clustering level is 2 and the HPEs were classified into two clusters, the common prescription patterns are obvious. Among 332 candidate prescriptions, 319 prescriptions follow the common patterns. The description of the patterns is that if a prescription contains the herbs of the cluster ( 1 ), it is very likely to have other herbs of another cluster ( 2 ); while a prescription has the herbs of 2 , it may have no herbs of 1 .

Medical herbs are located in Egypt in different areas and they are very important to increase the national income of Egypt. It is necessary to dry the herbs in their growing locations. As the growing locations are located far from the natural supply grid of Egypt, renewable energy sources such as PV&WIND are preferably utilized to achieve the drying process. Moreover, since the drying process is actually used to remove water from the herbs, thus it can preserve the herbs in storage drastically by preventing the attack of microorganisms during the moist conditions of herbs and also reduce their weight and bulk (for cheaper transport). Where, this paper selects, at first, the suitable drying site, and then it suggests. The suggested drying system is completely designed, and includes the following three systems: the solar thermal system, the dryer, and the renewable energy system.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:16:08.525Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:16:08.525Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b9886d7b5ad7298c91bb","title":"ThaiHerbMiner: A Thai Herbal Medicine Mining and Visualizing Tool","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=951FEE05A607AC4923A1B4D87935D2A6?doi=10.1.1.207.6234&rank=195","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Thai Traditional Medicine (TTM) has a long history in Thailand and is nowadays considered an effective alternative approach to the modern medicine.

Mathematical modeling presents the exchange of heat and mass transfer between material and drying air. Finite-difference method (FDM) based on Crank-Nicolson was used to discretise a parabolic type partial differential equations (PDE).

In this comparative study we examine the relative role of different plant traits for herb community patterns on both a local and regional scale in two contrasting alpine ecosystems in southern Norway: (1) a sub-continental region with more dry and productive, base-rich soils (Ho1, Hallingdal) and (2) an oceanic region, with humid acidic soils (Setesdal). Differences in species richness between regions were mainly due to higher herb richness in the base-rich region (n=55) than in the acidic region (n=13). Among traits, herb species seed weight was higher at the acidic site. The relative importance of traits for explaining herb local abundance and regional distribution tended to be stronger at the acidic site.

It is argued that SD is considered as patient classification because prior to the selection of the most appropriate formula from a set of relevant formulae for personalization, a practitioner has to label a patient belonging to a particular class (syndrome) first. Hence, to detect the patterns between herbs and symptoms via syndrome is a challenging problem; finding these patterns can help prepare a prescription that contributes to the efficacy of a treatment. In order to highlight this unique triangular relationship of symptom, syndrome, and herb, we propose a novel three-step mining approach. It first starts with the construction of a heterogeneous tripartite information network, which carries richer information. The second step is to systematically extract path-based topological features from this tripartite network. Finally, an unsupervised method is used to learn the best parameters associated with different features in deciding the symptom-herb relationships.

Volatile essential oil contents were analysed. Samples of blood, digesta and intestinal tissues were analysed to determine antioxidant activity, bacteria growth and intestinal histomorphology, respectively. The results showed that at 0-21 days of age the birds performed better on the diets up to 0.25% of herbal inclusion level. Increasing the inclusion level from 0.5 to 1.5% for Origanum minutiflorum, Thymbra spicata and partially for Rosmarinus officinalis increased feed consumption with lower weight gain and depressed efficiency of feed conversion, but not for Salvia tomentosa, Mrytus communis and Cumin. The results further showed that broilers could better perform on the diets up to 0.5% of inclusion level at 42 days. All levels (except 1.5%) for Cumin and Salvia tomentosa did not cause any impairment in performance of broilers. High inclusion levels (0.5 to 1.5%) reduced E. coli count. The selected herbs did not cause an oxidative stress at a given inclusion level. Of the plants Rosmarinus officinalis clearly demonstrated strong antioxidant effect. The high doses of Origanum minutiflorum caused depression in growth rate associated with shortened villus development of intestinal epithelium in broilers. However, increased growth rate with Cumin associated with longer villus and increased dry matter retention in broilers at 21 days were recorded.

Unlike thewesternmedical approachwhere a drug is prescribed against specific symptoms of patients, traditional Chinesemedicine (TCM) treatment has a unique step, which is called syndrome differentiation (SD). It is argued that SD is considered as patient classification because prior to the selection of the most appropriate formula from a set of relevant formulae for personalization, a practitioner has to label a patient belonging to a particular class (syndrome) first. Hence, to detect the patterns between herbs and symptoms via syndrome is a challenging problem; finding these patterns can help prepare a prescription that contributes to the efficacy of a treatment. In order to highlight this unique triangular relationship of symptom, syndrome, and herb, we propose a novel three-step mining approach. It first starts with the construction of a heterogeneous tripartite information network, which carries richer information.The second step is to systematically extract path-based topological features from this tripartite network. Finally, an unsupervised method is used to learn the best parameters associated with different features in deciding the symptom-herb relationships. Experiments have been carried out on four real-world patient records (Insomnia, Diabetes, Infertility, and Tourette syndrome) with comprehensive measurements. Interesting and insightful experimental results are noted and discussed. 1.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:16:42.876Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:16:42.876Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b9aa6d7b5ad7298c91dc","title":"Original Article In vitro anti-fibrotic activities of herbal compounds and herbs","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5C560F69FB05E64C60DBEF92AB4914B4?doi=10.1.1.955.9858&rank=228","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Background.

Common equine supplements like, echinacea, garlic, ginger, ginseng, and yucca among many others, are not regulated and few studies have investigated a safe yet effective dose of these compounds. Ginseng is commonly studied and has been found to exert an inhibitory effect on IL-1β and IL-6 gene expression, decrease TNF-α production by macrophages, decrease cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and suppress histamine and leukotriene release. On-going studies in horses are testing the anti-inflammatory effects of a single dose of ginger, postexercise.

In the very beginning of CHM practice, herbs were classified based on safety considerations. “Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing ” (Classic of Materia Medica), the first Chinese herbal classic published nearly 2000 years ago, classifies herbs into upper, middle and lower grades according to their safety profiles. The upper grade herbs nourish life and can be taken frequently over a long period of time. The middle grade herbs nourish constitutional types. The lower grade herbs expel diseases and should not be taken for a prolonged period of time. Strategies and procedures to minimize the adverse effects of herbs have been developed to further safeguard the use of Chinese herbs. Thus, toxicity can be reduced by proper pre-dispense processing. Toxicity can also be neutralized by adding another herb to counter the toxicity of an herb. Interactions between herbs have also been observed and documented in Chinese herbal medicine. There are herbal combinations that produce synergistic actions resulting in clinically beneficial effects. There are also combinations that diminish each other’s actions or lead to unforeseen toxicity. Combinations of herbs that may lead to harmful interactions are to be avoided (Zhu & Woerdenbag, 1995). In classical CHM texts, herbs with different degrees of toxicities are graded and are clearly marked d in their “property ” section in herbal texts.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:17:22.152Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:17:22.152Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b9d26d7b5ad7298c91fc","title":"Vitro and In Vivo: A Case for Herb-Drug Interactions","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5C3150FAEB0828487FA0F53F45664B2F?doi=10.1.1.1083.6224&rank=20","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): ","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:17:22.152Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:17:22.152Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84b9d26d7b5ad7298c91fb","title":"Drug Interactions Update: Drugs, Herbs, and Oral Anticoagulation","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5C3150FAEB0828487FA0F53F45664B2F?doi=10.1.1.471.4675&rank=19","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Abstract.

Interactions may still occur in patients, however, despite negative pre-marketing studies in healthy volunteers. The clinical significance and intensity of warfarin interactions with prescription drugs (e.g., celecoxib, proton pump inhibitors, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) can often be predicted on the basis of known metabolic characteristics of the drugs and warfarin enantiomers. Drug interactions with herbal medicinals are much more difficult to characterize and predict because of the lack of federal regulations regarding safety, effi-cacy, and manufacturing standards.

What follows is a review of several botanicals that are either commonly used or have documented evidence of benefi t for some of the common problems women encounter during these times. NAUSEA AND VOMITING OF PREGNANCY Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is a common experience for many women (33%-50%), usually beginning by 4 to 8 weeks' gestation and disappearing by the 16th week. The etiology is not known. Mild cases of morning sickness generally pose no significant risk to mother or baby and can be safely treated at home with self-care measures. The diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum is made when NVP is serious enough to cause a weight loss of at least 5% of the prepregnancy weight, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and ketosis. This condition necessitates hospitalization. Women are the largest consumers of healthcare, and this extends to their utilization of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Researchers have attempted to uncover the reasons why women turn to CAM in general and to botanical medicine in particular. Desire to have personal control over their health has been cited as the strongest motive for women to use herbal medicine. Second was dissatisfaction with conventional treatment and its disregard for a holistic approach, as well as concerns about the side effects of medications. 1 These concerns may explain, in part, the fact that many women use herbal remedies during pregnancy. A survey of 578 pregnant women in the eastern United States reported that 45% of respondents had used herbal medicines, 2 and a survey of 588 women in Australia revealed that 36% had used at least 1 herbal product during pregnancy. 2 Women probably feel comfortable using herbal remedies because of their perceived safety, easy access, and the widespread availability of information about them (ie, Internet, magazines, books). While it is true that many botanicals are mild in both treatment effects and side effects, the data regarding safety during pregnancy are very limited. Given the small sample sizes in clinical trials studying botanicals in pregnant women, only large differences in measures of pregnancy outcomes would likely be detected. For example, if an herb were thought to increase the rate of spontaneous abortion from 6% to 7%, a sample size of more than 19 000 women would be needed. It is highly unlikely that there will be any studies of a botanical (or drug) with this large a sample size. So when addressing the safety of an herb during pregnancy, we must look at the totality of the evidence, which includes traditional and contemporary use, animal studies, pharmacological studies, and clinical trial data, when available. Survey data tell us that women often do not share their use of herbal remedies with their healthcare providers due to fear of offending providers or to the belief that clinicians will be ignorant about their use.

Interestingly, the development of Echinacea species for medicinal purposes stems from use by indigenous American people, but research has been conducted predominantly in Germany (Bauer and Wagner 1991). On the other hand, the reputation of ginseng is firmly planted in China and has spread west in modern times, research in China, Japan, and Korea, being bolstered by European investigations of mainly extracts of the Asian species, Panax ginseng. Following its discovery outside present-day Montreal, Quebec, in 1716 (Foster 1992), the trade in North American ginseng, Panax quinquefolius, grew steadily and now constitutes a considerable market in the Orient, where roughly 90 % of Canada- and US-grown root is sold. Only one of the additionally recognized Panax species, namely Panax notoginseng (Sanchi or Tienchi ginseng), is of commercial significance, primarily in Asia, where it finds application as a hemostatic, cardiotonic, and anti-infective agent (Gao et al. 1996). The traditional use of echinacea by native Americans as a topical anti-infective and snake-bite remedy, and to assuage coughs associated with colds, was presumably the impetus for investigation of its anti-microbial potential.

These diseases are caused by dyslipidemia, lack of physical activities, smoking, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, oxidative stress and excessive alcohol consumption. Natural products have played a significant role in drug discovery and development especially for agents against cancer and infectious disease. Natural compounds possess highly diverse and complex molecular structures and often provide highly specific biological activities. Ethnopharmacological use of plant-derived natural products has been a major source for discovery of potential medicinal agents. A wide variety of extracts from these plants have been used for about a century as alternative source of medical care for most of the population of the developing world. The extracts of some medicinal plants treat cardiovascular diseases without affecting coronary blood flow. Phytochemicals such as carotenoids, flavonoids, cinnamic acids, phenolics and proanthocyanidins possess antioxidant properties which enable them to play a significant role in the adsorption and neutralization of free radicals mainly due to their redox properties.

Many commercially available botanical products are being marketed in the United States with little or no publicly available scientific validation of efficacy or consistency. For botanicals to be reliable for research purposes and consumer products, they must be standardized with sufficient quality controls to ensure consistent composition, safety, and potency. This includes uniform cultivation of source plants with controls to monitor for contamination from other species, pesticides, and environmental toxins. The active components of botanicals must be identified by activity-guided fractionation with the use of in vitro assays that require little test material followed by validation in vivo. Concentrations of active compounds within the botanicals can then be accurately measured to ensure the delivery of a dependable dose in the final product. The use of bioenhancing agents may be considered for compounds with poor bioavailability.

Herbal medicines involve the integration of several therapeutic experiences and practices of indigenous systems of medicine that may span many previous generations, which often provides valuable guidelines to the selection, preparation and application of herbal formulation for the treatment, control and management of variety of ailments. According to World Health Organization, 60 % of the world’s population depends on traditional medicine and 80 % of the population in developing countries depends almost entirely on traditional medicine practices and herbal medicines for their primary health care needs. As a result of increasing demand for herbal medicines, there are increasing concerns about the safety, standardization, efficacy, quality, availability and preservation of herbal products by policy-makers, health professionals as well as the general public. Improvement in the quality of herbal medicines could be achieved by deliberate implementation of good agricultural practices (GAPs) at the point of cultivation of medicinal plants and good manufacturing practices (GMPs) during the process of manufacture and packaging of finished herbal products, as well as post-marketing quality assurance surveillance. Additionally, following the current sustained improvements in quality control and regulatory measures in many countries of the world, it is envisaged that in the near future, herbal medicinal practices will be integrated into the conventional medicines.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:18:19.094Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:18:19.094Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84ba0b6d7b5ad7298c9223","title":"Education in herbal medicine (2004)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=DF3B1A043F4F7DC70530CDF02802F9D9?doi=10.1.1.928.7642&rank=9","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): output of Southern Cross University authors and researchers, and to increase visibility and impact through open access to researchers around the world.

Despite many successful applications of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in the treatment and prevention of neurological diseases (ND), the fully scientific understanding of CHM’s action mechanisms had been hampered for lack of appropriate methods to explore the combinatorial rules, the synergistic mechanisms, and the molecular basis of CHM. As an improved pharmacology approach, cerebrospinal fluid pharmacology (CSFP), based on the fact that cerebrospinal fluid plays an important role in the health maintenance of specific survival environment for neurons and glial cells, has been constructed and applied to CHM research for treatingND. In the present review, the concept and advantages of CSFP are briefly introduced.The approaches and key technologies of CSFP in CHM research are also collated and analyzed. Furthermore, the developing tendency of CSFP is summarized, and its framework in CHM research is also proposed. In summary, CSFP provides a new strategy not only to eliminate some barriers of CHM research for treating ND, but also to broaden the pharmacology research for bridging the gap between CHM and modern medicine.

However, it is logical to pose the questions: (i) is there a role for the pharmacologist in herbal medicine (or phytotherapy)? (ii) can we do without pharmacologists'? First, two worlds-drug researchers (pharmacologists) and herbal medicines-yesterday appearing in opposition, are today closer and it is not unusual to read scientific works describing herbal extracts in journals traditionally dedicated to the study of synthetic drugs. Second, clinical application of herbal medicines is evaluable through the methods of modern clinical pharmacology. Efficacy and safety of medicinal plants represent naturally the object of interest for the pharmacologist and it is surely this aspect which gives the most important information on herbal medicine use. Many plants have been studied and results published showing, one time good or another poor, efficacy. Safety aspects of some of the most frequently used plants are now well known. For example, today we learn to use hypericum and we do not give it to patients taking other drugs because the interactions of hypericum with them. Contraindications of other plants, often represented by interactions with drugs, are finally known (Ginkgo biloba and drugs acting on blood coagulation).

Yet little literature addresses ethical challenges in this research. In this paper, we apply concepts in a comprehensive ethical framework for clinical research to international traditional herbal medicine research. We examine in detail three key, underappreciated dimensions of the ethical framework in which particularly difficult questions arise for international herbal medicine research: social value, scientific validity and favourable risk–benefit ratio. Significant challenges exist in determining shared concepts of social value, scientific validity and favourable risk–benefit ratio across international research collaborations. However, we argue that collaborative partnership, including democratic deliberation, offers the context and process by which many of the ethical challenges in international herbal medicine research can, and should be, resolved. By “cross-training ” investigators, and investing in safety-monitoring infrastructure, the issues identified by this comprehensive framework can promote ethically sound international herbal medicine research that contributes to global health.

It has performed well clinically and, for this discussion, it has shown great promise for the treatment of many symptoms which modern medicine has associated for centuries with lung cancer. Many medicinal plants have been tested for anticancer activity such as antofine, acutiaporberine, etc. The compounds which have been isolated from these medicinal herbs include a variety of alkaloids, triterpenoids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and polysaccharides.

The medicinal botanicals with the longest tradition, and for which extensive data are available, are Chinese herbal medicines and their Japanese counterparts-Kampo medicines. This review focuses on some representative examples of studies examining the effects of some traditional Chinese medicines on various aspects of the immune response. In vitro as well as in vivo studies are cited, the latter including not only animal experiments but also clinical trials. Although by no means exhaustive, this review attempts to show that much research has focused on the specific beneficial effects of Chinese herbal medicines. Studies examining the mechanisms by which they exert their immunomodulatory actions, however, are found much less frequently. Nonetheless, even the limited number of mechanistic experiments presented here reveal that numerous mechanisms are likely involved in the various actions of even a single medicine.

Methods We developed a bioactive equivalence oriented feed-back screening method and applied it to discover the BECCs from an herbal preparation Cardiotonic Pill (CP). The operations in-clude chemical profiling of CP, followed by an iterative loop of determining, collecting and evaluating candidate BECCs. Results A combination of 18 compounds was identified as BECCs from CP, which accounts for 15.0 % (w/w) of original CP. We have demonstrated that the BECCs were as effective as CP in cell models and in a rat model of myocardial infarction. Conclusions This work answers the key question of which are real bioactive components for CP that have been used in clinic for many years, and provides a promising approach for discovering BECCs from herbal medicines.

Purpose. Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is a common gynecological complaint among adolescent girls and women of reproductive age. This study aims to review the findings of published articles on the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of herbal medicines for PD. Methods. In vitro and in vivo studies of herbal compounds, individual herbal extracts, or herbal formula decoctions published from their inception to April 2014 were included in this review. Results. A total of 18 studies involving herbal medicines exhibited their inhibitory effect on PD. The majority of in vitro studies investigated the inhibition of uterine contractions. In vivo studies suggest that herbal medicines exert a peripheral analgesic effect and a possible anti-inflammatory activity via the inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. The mechanisms of herbal medicines for PD are associated with PG level reduction, suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 expression, superoxide dismutase activation and malondialdehyde reduction, nitric oxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and nuclear factor-kappa B reduction, stimulation of somatostatin receptor, intracellular Ca 2+ reduction, and recovery of phospholipid metabolism. Conclusions. Herbal medicines are thought to be promising sources for the development of effective therapeutic agents for PD.

As commercialization and increased demand safety, quality and assurance of Ayurvedic herbal medicines is biggest lacuna. The adulteration of herbal materials usually occurs as a result of materials not having readily distinguishable morphological features, materials sharing similar common names and the substitution of economically valuable materials with inexpensive herbs. Proper authentication process is necessary to prevent the adulteration. Since the standardization of botanical preparations most of the regulatory authorities suggest macroscopic, microscopic and chemical evaluation like TLC, HPTLC and HPLC. However, these methods have limitations because the composition and relative amount of chemicals in a particular species of plant varies with growing conditions-harvesting period, post harvesting period and storage conditions.

Methods: Antioxidant activity was measured by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, superoxide radical scavenging activity, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), ferrous ion chelating power. The total phenols content was measured by Folin–Ciocalteu assay, the flavonoids content by the AlCl3 colorimetric method. Antiglycation activity was determined using the formation of AGE fluorescence intensity, Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine, and the level of fructosamine. The protein oxidation was examined using the level of protein carbonyl content and thiol group. Results: The results showed that the content of total phenolics, flavonoids and total anthocyanins in RGSE was 246.3 ± 0.9 mg gallic acid equivalent/g dried extract, 215.9 ± 1.3 mg catechin equivalent/g dried extract, and 36.7 ± 0.8 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalent/g dried extract, respectively.

Herbal medicine is one of the most commonly used methods. To understand the effectiveness, reliability, and quality of CAM and provide standardization in its analysis, its prevalence and the factors influencing its use must be identified. This study was conducted to identify the prevalence of CAM use and the effective factors in our population. Materials and Methods: A stratified multistage probability sampling design was used in this cross-sectional, population-based study, which was conducted in Aydin. Participants were interviewed face to face by trained interviewers with a questionnaire. The answers for the open-ended questions were categorized. Univariate and multiple (backward Wald) logistic regression and chi-square test were used for the statistical analysis. A P value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Totally, 873 people completed the questionnaire; 539 (61.7%) were female, 334 (38.3%) were male. Fifty-eight percent of the participants (n: 511) reported that they had used a CAM method at least once in the previous year. More than half of the participants had used herbal medicine (55.4%), and the most commonly used herb was lime (n: 426, 88.1%). The reasons for the use of herbal medicine were mostly for prevention and for treatment. In the previous year, 233 (26.7%) of the participants stated that they had applied one of the CAM methods as a treatment for their children. Health status perception, being a non-smoker and belief that “CAM was superior to conventional medicine ” were determined as the factors that influenced CAM use. Conclusions: CAM, especially herbal medicine, is commonly used in our population, and individuals use these methods not only for themselves but also for their children.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:15.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:15.142Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84ba7f6d7b5ad7298c9283","title":"REPORT Significance of herbal medicine in removing excessive iron content in human","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A2D7B0F3CF4CFA08B5193FA961A2A152?doi=10.1.1.1037.337&rank=105","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda):  Abstract: Heavy metals in cigarette tobacco such as iron may cause a serious damage on human health.

The objective of this case-control study was to determine the association between herbal medicine use during pregnancy and perinatal mortality in Tumpat District, Kelantan, Malaysia. Cases were mothers who gave birth from June 2002 to June 2005 with a history of perinatal mortality, while controls were those without a history of perinatal infant mortality. A total of 316 mothers (106 cases and 210 controls) were interviewed. The use of unidentified herbs prepared by traditional midwives and other types of herbal medicines during the first trimester of pregnancy were positively associated with perinatal mortality (OR=5.24, 95% CI=1.13; 24.23 and OR=8.90, 95%, CI=1.35; 58.53, respectively).

It was recently reported that SF up-regulates CYP3A expression. The mechanism of SF-induced CYP3A expression is unknown. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that SF-induced CYP3A expression is mediated by the activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR). We used two cell lines, DPX2 and HepaRG, to investigate the role of PXR in SF-induced CYP3A expression. The DPX2 cell line is derived from HepG2 cells with the stable transfection of human PXR and a luciferase re-porter gene linked with a human PXR response element identified in the CYP3A4 gene promoter. In DPX2 cells, SF activated PXR in a concentration-dependent manner. We used a metabolomic ap-proach to identify the chemical constituents in SF, which were further analyzed for their effect on PXR activation and CYP3A regulation. One chemical in SF, N-methylcytisine, was identified as an individual chemical that activated PXR. HepaRG is a highly differentiated hepatoma cell line that mimics human hepatocytes. In HepaRG cells, N-methylcytisine significantly induced CYP3A4 expression, and this induction was suppressed by the PXR antag-onist sulforaphane. These results suggest that SF induces CYP3A expression via the activation of PXR.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:38.249Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:38.249Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84ba966d7b5ad7298c9293","title":"Letter to the Editor Regarding “The toxicity of Callilepis laureola, a South","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=71D11DB41DACCF4C50F6F74F5E1B8821?doi=10.1.1.578.1560&rank=121","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): African traditional herbal medicine.”","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:38.249Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:38.249Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84ba966d7b5ad7298c9297","title":"Review Article Chinese Herbal Medicine and Depression: The Research Evidence","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=71D11DB41DACCF4C50F6F74F5E1B8821?doi=10.1.1.777.487&rank=125","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Positive results were reported: no signi�cant differences from medication, greater effect than medication or placebo, reduced adverse event rates when combined or compared with antidepressants. However, limitations in methodology and reportingwere revealed.Conclusions. Despite promising results, particularly forXiaoYao San and itsmodi�cations, the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine in depression could not be fully substantiated based on current evidence. Further well-designed, well-reported trials that re�ect practice may be worth pursuing. 1.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:38.249Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:38.249Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84ba966d7b5ad7298c9296","title":"Original Article Prescriptions of Chinese Herbal Medicines for Insomnia in Taiwan during 2002","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=71D11DB41DACCF4C50F6F74F5E1B8821?doi=10.1.1.1081.1621&rank=124","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda):  Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been commonly used for treating insomnia in Asian countries for centuries.

We obtained the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) outpatient claims from the National Health Insurance in Taiwan for the year 2002. Patients with insomnia were identified from the diagnostic code of International Classification of Disease among claimed visiting files. Corresponding prescription files were analyzed, and an association rule was applied to evaluate the co-prescription of CHM. Results showed that there were 16 134 subjects who visited TCM clinics for insomnia in Taiwan during 2002 and received a total of 29 801 CHM prescriptions. Subjects between 40 and 49 years of age comprised the largest number of those treated (25.3%). In addition, female subjects used CHMs for insomnia more frequently than male subjects (female : male = 1.94 : 1). There was an average of 4.8 items prescribed in the form of either an individual Chinese herb or formula in a single CHM prescription for insomnia. Shou-wu-teng (Polygonum multiflorum) was the most commonly prescribed single Chinese herb, while Suan-zao-ren-tang was the most commonly prescribed Chinese herbal formula. According to the association rule, the most commonly prescribed CHM drug combination was Suan-zao-ren-tang plus Long-dan-xie-gan-tang, while the most commonly prescribed triple drug combination was Suan-zao-ren-tang, Albizia julibrissin, and P. multiflorum. Nevertheless, further clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these CHMs for treating insomnia.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:38.249Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:38.249Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84ba966d7b5ad7298c9299","title":"Review Article Safety of Chinese Herbal Medicine for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (2015)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=71D11DB41DACCF4C50F6F74F5E1B8821?doi=10.1.1.807.8104&rank=127","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Copyright © 2015 Meaghan Coyle et al.This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is increasingly used by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, there has been no systematic evaluation of its safety. This review examined the adverse events (AEs) reported in clinical studies of CHM for COPD. Five English databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and CENTRAL) and four Chinese databases (CBM, CNKI, CQVIP, and Wanfang Data) were searched from inception to May 2013. Adverse event data, including nature, severity, author-assigned causality, management, and outcome, were extracted from included studies. Descriptive statistics were used for the rate of adverse events. Of the 152 included studies, AEs were reported in 47 studies.The rate of adverse events was slightly lower in the CHM groups compared with controls (84 events in 5,909 participants, 1.4 % versus 102 events in 5,676 participants, 1.8%). Themost frequently reported adverse event was nausea (28 cases in the CHM groups and 19 cases in the control groups), which was more common in studies where CHM was combined with pharmacotherapy to treat acute exacerbation of COPD. Other frequent adverse events were abdominal discomfort, dry mouth, and dizziness. Detailed information about the adverse events was scant. Overall, CHM appears to be well tolerated in people with COPD. 1.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:38.249Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:38.249Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84ba966d7b5ad7298c9298","title":"ACUPUNCTURE IMPROVES THE EFFECTS OF CHINESE HERBAL MEDICINE IN TREATING ENDOMETRIOSIS MODEL RATS","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=71D11DB41DACCF4C50F6F74F5E1B8821?doi=10.1.1.1055.6182&rank=126","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda):  ABSTRACT The present study was aimed to investigate whether acupuncture could significantly enhance the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in treating endometriosis model rats. A total of 40 female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with body weight of 200 ±20 g were included. Operational transplantation was used with animal models. The rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: sham-operation control group (Group A), model group (Group B), CHM combined with acupuncture group (Group C), CHM group (Group D), Danazol group (Group E) with 8 rats in each group. During the treatment, two rats in Group B and one rat in Group E passed away. When the treatment ended, all the left rats were sacrificed. The samples of peritoneal fluids, serum and the ectopic endometrium were taken. The serum levels of cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) and interleukin 18(IL-18) in the peritoneal fluids were detected using enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay. The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA expression levels in the ectopic endometrium were measured by Real-time PCR. The results showed that in the rats from Groups A, C, D and E, the serum CA-125 levels, COX-2 mRNA expression in the ectopic endometrium and the IL-18 levels in the peritoneal fluids were significantly lower than those of Group B (P<0.05). The serum CA-125 levels and COX-2 mRNA expression in the ectopic endometrium of the rats in Group C were significantly lower than those of Group D (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference between Group C and E (P>0.05). The levels of IL-18 in the peritoneal fluids of the rats in Group C were markedly lower than those of Group D and E (P<0.05). It is then concluded that acupuncture treatment can improve the effects of CHM in treating endometriosis model rats.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:38.249Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:20:38.249Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84ba966d7b5ad7298c929a","title":"MOJ Immunology Herbal Medicines: Great Applause and Less Clinical Use Volume 2 Issue 4- 2015","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=71D11DB41DACCF4C50F6F74F5E1B8821?doi=10.1.1.1008.5963&rank=128","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Many scientists in different fields of pharmaceutical research have been searching among the rich dictionaries of traditional medicine for potential natural drugs.

However, it is logical to pose the questions: (i) is there a role for the pharmacologist in herbal medicine (or phytotherapy)? (ii) can we do without pharmacologists’? First, two worlds—drug researchers (pharmacologists) and herbal medicines—yesterday appearing in opposition, are today closer and it is not unusual to read scientific works describing herbal extracts in journals traditionally dedicated to the study of synthetic drugs. Second, clinical application of herbal medicines is evaluable through the methods of modern clinical pharmacology. Efficacy and safety of medicinal plants represent naturally the object of interest for the pharmacologist and it is surely this aspect which gives the most important information on herbal medicine use. Many plants have been studied and results published showing, one time good or another poor, efficacy. Safety aspects of some of the most frequently used plants are now well known. For example, today we learn to use hypericum and we do not give it to patients taking other drugs because the interactions of hypericum with them. Contraindications of other plants, often represented by interactions with drugs, are finally known (Ginkgo biloba and drugs acting on blood coagulation). In conclusion, antagonistic behavior of pharmacologists versus herbal medicines is not useful.

Methods: The present study evaluated ethnomedicinal plants and their uses following literature review, comparison, field observations, and analysis. Comparison was made against earlier standard literature of medicinal plants and ethnomedicine of the same area, the common uses of the Ayurveda and the latest common phytochemical findings. The field study for primary data collection was carried out from 2006-2008. Results: The herbal medicine in far-west Nepal is the basis of treatment of most illness through traditional knowledge. The medicine is made available via ancient, natural health care practices such as tribal lore, home herbal remedy, and the Baidhya, Ayurveda and Amchi systems. The traditional herbal medicine has not only survived but also thrived in the trans-cultural environment with its intermixture of ethnic traditions and beliefs.

With tens of thousands of plant species on earth, we are endowed with an enormous wealth of medicinal remedies from Mother Nature. Natural products and their derivatives represent more than 50 % of all the drugs in modern therapeutics. Because of the low success rate and huge capital investment need, the research and development of conventional drugs are very costly and difficult.

It became my ambition to link the knowledge of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda from the Indian subcontinent and their integration with other systems of medicine, including Western medicine (WM), to achieve the concept of Sustainable Medicine, firstly for animals and then for humans. The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has implemented a technology development program to quickly establish the key technologies, and this is a moment of opportunity for Taiwan’s traditional herbal medicine industry to upgrade and transform itself.

The quality and safety of these herbal products has now become a serious issue due to increasing pollution in air, water, soil, etc. Pharmacognostical analysis of medicinal herbs remains challenging issues for analytical chemists, as herbs are a complicated system of mixtures.

Medicinal herbs are known for their multifaceted implications and thus can form an effective treatment schedule against NASH. Till date, several plant extracts, polyherbal formulations, and phytochemicals have been evaluated for their possible therapeutic potential in preventing onset and progression of NASH in experimental models, but clinical studies using the same are sparse. Herbal extracts with antioxidants, antidiabetic, and antihyperlipidemic properties have been shown to ameliorate symptoms of NASH.

Sometimes traditional medicine involves a sophisticated theory or system, though the knowledge of traditional medicine is often passed on, verbally or otherwise, from generation to generation (Zhang, 2000). Most people in non-industrialised countries receive traditional health care (THC) for their everyday health care needs. The World Health Organisation has consistently estimated that 60–80 % of the population of these countries rely on THC for their basic health care needs, either on its own or in conjunction with modern medical care. Studies show that demand for traditional medicine is increasing in many countries (Bannerman, 1993). Since 1977, the WHO has called for recognition of traditional healers, and in 1978 declared at Alma Ata that African traditional healers should be part of the primary health care team (WHO, 1978a). The increased demand for traditional medical services, in both industrialised and developing countries, is also likely due to their increased formalisation, improved quality and safety standards, and their use as a complementary therapy.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:21:18.381Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:21:18.381Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84babe6d7b5ad7298c92b2","title":"Traditional medicine (2011)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5DF1D81CFB102BE717B2051CD1313CD4?doi=10.1.1.724.5323&rank=2","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): This article appeared in a journal published by Elsevier.

However, TM has not been integrated into the formal healthcare delivery system of the country. This might be partly due to attitudes and perceptions towards it. The aim of the study was to find out the attitudes and perceptions of Scientific Medical Practitioners (SMPs) towards TM in Ghana and then propose measures for the full integration of TM into Ghana’s healthcare delivery system. A descriptive survey methodology was used to solicit responses from all 33 SMPs practising in the Central Region of Ghana. An in-depth interview and self administered questionnaire were the main instruments used for data collection. The main result of the study is that, although SMPs would want the full integration of TM into the formal healthcare delivery system, when confronted with possible ways of working with TMPs they showed reluctance to accepting them as equal partners since they perceived their practice as inferior to theirs. In order to reduce the mistrust and lack of understanding of the philosophy that underlie Scientific Medicine and Traditional Medicine, there must be regular consultations and dialogue between and among practitioners of the two medical systems. This may engender the needed trust and respect that the practitioners need to accord each other in order to develop and integrate TM into the national healthcare system.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:21:18.381Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:21:18.381Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84baca6d7b5ad7298c92bc","title":"Traditional Medicine and Healers","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=B9F343922CDD0DE2E688EB733421AC17?doi=10.1.1.583.5400&rank=12","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): With the many changes in South Africa and a renewed challenge to provide accessible primary health care to all, the role of traditional medicine has once again moved into the spotlight.

Despite numerous attempts of govern-mental interference, traditional medicine continues to strive throughout Africa and certain parts of the world. During colonialism, many colonists accused traditional healers of practicing witchcraft, which led to the prohibition of the practice across various regions in Africa. Today, South Africa is home to more than 200,000 traditional healers who care for more than 27 million people. This article will primarily focus on the history of traditional medicinal practices in South Africa and its rise in modern-day times as a form of complementary alternative medicine (CAM).","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:21:30.019Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:21:30.019Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84baca6d7b5ad7298c92c2","title":"Clinical effectiveness of Traditional Medicines (2013)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=B9F343922CDD0DE2E688EB733421AC17?doi=10.1.1.381.793&rank=18","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): There is a general conception that, herbs are natural therefore, they are completely safe.

Arabic people were familiar with rashes as well as with the other infectious diseases. The famous physician Rhazes (850-932) described smallpox and differentiated it from varicella and measles in a paper nowadays considered as the first monograph in the medical literature. Smallpox was also present in our country with epidemic waves occurring from time to time. In the writings of the Romanian chroniclers no devastating epidemic of smallpox similar to those recorded in Western Europe is described. It is believed that epidemics were of low intensity, and that the disease was endemic. Old Romanian literature mentions notable people who had smallpox, such as Stefan, the son of Radu Voda, Sigismund Bartori or Lucsandra, proposed by Matei Basarab. Reputed researchers in the history of Romanian medicine, such as Valeriu Bologa and Pompei Samarian, claim that in the Romanian traditional medicine variolation and smallpox vaccination were practiced since ancient times. Evidence on variolation and empirical vaccination practiced by the Romanian peasants from Transylvania, Bucovina, Banat, Moldova and Muntenia, as well as by the Macedo-Romanians (Aromanians from Macedonia) come from physicians who used these techniques, and foreigners who visited Romania and described the habits of its people in various publications. The first such mention was made by the Venetian Francisco Griselini in 1789 who in “Geschichte des Temesvarer Banats ” described two techniques of inoculating pustular smallpox material from sick persons to healthy children. The first technique consisted in the placement of the pustular material directly on the arm skin previously strongly rubbed with a rugged cloth until the area became inflamed. The second technique consisted in the superficial incision of the arm skin into which a smallpox pustule was placed.

Two Streams The diverse expressions of medical knowledge in Indian society for purposes of classification can be fitted into two sets of traditions a set of oral traditions or folk medicine and a set of codified traditions, Each set comprises a diversity of traditions that is why it is referred to as a “set”. In order to address issues of IPR related to indigenous medical knowledge, we need to understand the genesis and scope and nature of the knowledge systems in both these sets and also the nature of their ownership. The Codified stream In the first set viz the set of “codified” traditions the medical knowledge is documented and presented in thousands of medical manuscripts. They deal with subjects related to medicine and surgery. There is also literature on medicinal materials viz plants, animals, metals and minerals and products, processes and therapeutical applications, Over 10,000 natural products are documented in traditional texts along with their applications. In the Indian context the codified medical traditions are drawn from knowledge systems like ayurveda, Unani, siddha and the Tibetan system. In the case of Ayurveda, Siddha the genesis of these systems goes as far back as 1500BC from which time they have been evolving. The Unani and Tibetan system also have an old history which is linked at some point to the evolution of ayurveda. The medical literature from these traditions may be in both classical and regional scripts and languages. There is no “exhaustive ” catalogue of the corpus of medical literature available in any of these medical traditions, but “first list ” of literary sources can certainly be drawn up. The codified traditions are evidently in the public domain. The custodians of this set of medical traditions are for all practical purposes, several hundred thousands physicians, who are its present day carriers. These consist of the Kaviraj’s of West Bengal, the Namboodri’s of kerala, the Acharyas and siddhas of Tamil Nadu, Buddhist monks in Arunachal Pradesh and","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:21:53.133Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:21:53.133Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bae16d7b5ad7298c92cf","title":"The Use of Naturopathy as Adjuvant to Traditional Medicine","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D8AC15AC697ABF50593FE625141D0325?doi=10.1.1.1060.2136&rank=31","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda):  Abstract: Alternative medicines have long offered opportunities for patients and doctors to treat illness.

The value of plants for medicines is more widely recognized and the “intellectual property rights ” (IPR) connected with their use have been debated worldwide. “Convention on Biological Diversity ” (CBD) which was signed in Rio in 1992, enforces protection of the rights of local people and local knowledge as well as conservation of the biological resources which forms the basic of all those health systems. Thus, conservation of local and indigenous peoples ’ rights over their knowledge and resources are an important element of all contemporary conservation approaches.Generally, the intellectual property rights are protected under the patent systems in many countries, whereas access to such legal procedures are not easily available for most of the indigenous communities.

Background: Traditional medicine is the ancient and culture bound medical practice which existed in human societies before the application of modern science to health. Around 80 % of Ethiopians relies on traditional medicines. Although some traditional medical practices in children are useful and contributing positively and need to be strengthen, some are harmful from the perspective of health. In Ethiopia, studies conducted so far are very limited and focused on adults. As a result, this study was conducted to assess the prevalence and factors associated with parental traditional medicine practice for children. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess prevalence and factors associated with parental traditional medicine use for children in Motta Town. Methods: Community based cross-sectional study design was used. Data was collected using structured interviewer administered questionnaire.

Today, herbal products are being used worldwide in a variety of healthcare settings, and as a home remedies. Herbal products are often promoted to the public as being “natural ” and completely “safe ” alternatives to conventional medicines. African plants used medicinally are widely assumed to be safe, but many are potentially toxic (Fennell et al., 2004). The efficacy, safety and quality of raw medicinal plant materials and plant products depend on intrinsic or external factors. Inadvertent contamination by microbial or chemical agents during any of the production stages can also affect the quality, safety and efficacy. Medicinal plants collected in the wild may be contaminated by other species or plant parts through misidentification, accidental contamination or intentional adulteration, all of which may have unsafe consequences. Herbal medicines (sometimes referred to as ‘phytomedicines’) exhibit some peculiar characteristics, namely: the active principles are frequently unknown; standardization, stability and quality control are feasible but not easy; the availability and quality of raw materials are frequently problematic; well-controlled, double-blind clinical and toxicological studies to prove their efficacy and safety are rare; empirical use in folk medicine is a very important characteristic; they have a wide range of therapeutic uses and are suitable for chronic treatments; the occurrence of undesirable side effects seems to be less frequent with herbal medicines, but well-controlled, randomized clinical trials have revealed that they also exist; they are usually affordable and cost less than synthetic drugs","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:17.701Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:17.701Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84baf96d7b5ad7298c92e5","title":"A historical overview of traditional medicine practices and policy in Ethiopia (2006)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1AF98DDAFA8D5EB41D0C4C042BB60321?doi=10.1.1.1035.3352&rank=53","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda):  Abstract Background: Although traditional medicine plays an important role in Ethiopian society, knowledge about the extent and characteristics of traditional healing practices and practitioners is limited and has frequently been ignored in the national health system. Objective: To review history of practices and policies on traditional medicine in Ethiopia. Methods: A systematic review of available literature on Ethiopian traditional medicine and policy documents was carried out. Google, Pub Med and Medline online internet searches were done to access relevant material. In addition, materials from Jimma University Library and the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health Library were used. Several authorities were also contacted to supplement the literature. Result: There are a number of traditional medicinal practices that reflect the diversity of Ethiopian cultures. Ethiopian traditional medicine is concerned not only with the curing of diseases but also with the protection and promotion of human physical, spiritual, social, mental and material wellbeing. The many categories of traditional medicinal practices dealing with these different aspects of health include: spiritual healing, prevention, as well as curative and surgical practices. The health and drug policies of the Ethiopian Ministry of Health recognize the important role traditional health systems play in health care. Unfortunately, little has been done in recent decades to enhance and develop the beneficial aspects of traditional medicine including relevant research to explore possibilities for its gradual integration into modern medicine. Conclusion: The Ethiopian government firmly supports and encourages traditional medicine through its policies as part of the national heritage. Despite these commitments on the policies, the government's ability to implement and provide increased resources for the study, as well as sustainable use of traditional medicine and their integration with modern medical practice has been limited.

Based on the literature survey, it seems that the oral cavity is the most important origin of halitosis; therefore, this area could be considered as the best target for the treatment. Halitosis is a well-known disorder in Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM); Avicenna and some other famous Iranian traditional physicians have described this condition in their manuscripts precisely. Herbal therapy was the major treatment suggested by Iranian scholars in which mixtures of medicinal plants were used in the form of mouthwashes and other oral formulations. In the present study, six Iranian ancient medical texts were screened for the herbs with anti-halitosis effects. Subsequent to this study, the medicinal herbs were listed and scored based on the frequency of their repetition. Moreover, the effort has been taken to provide the best scientific name for each plant as well as searching modern studies about their biological effects.

This study has made in Nalla mala forest, there are more than 6 tribal people living in different parts of the forest like palutla, Nekkanti Nadathadika, Chinthala gudams etc. I met the so called Dora, (Doctor) and collected 80 % of medicinal plants. I also met another tribe chenchu leader who gave me another 20 % of medicinal plants and their use I collated nearly 25 plants and 30 of their families. These, medicinal plants are very popular in near by towns. Most of the town people visit these gudams for medicines.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:17.701Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:17.701Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb056d7b5ad7298c92ed","title":"Mutagenicity of Chinese traditional medicine Semen Armeniacae (2009)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=86676F7B0830C939860A9190EAE45A2B?doi=10.1.1.357.1532&rank=61","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): amarum by two modified Ames tests","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:29.116Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:29.116Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb056d7b5ad7298c92ee","title":"TRADITIONAL MEDICINAL PLANTS OF GUREZ (KASHMIR) – AN ETHNOBOTANICAL STUDY (1990)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=86676F7B0830C939860A9190EAE45A2B?doi=10.1.1.270.3297&rank=62","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): ABSTRACT: Gurez Valley is situated along the Krishna Ganga river and is less exploited.

Four medicinal plants namely Terminalia arjuna(bark), Butea monosperma(bark), Mollugo nudicaulis(whole plant), Evolvulus alsinoides(whole plant) were collected from different places in Tamil Nadu, India. Methods: Methanol extracts of these plants were assessed for antimicrobial activity using disc diffusion method at 5mg/disc and 10mg/disc. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and phytochemical analysis were also determined. Results: Methanol extract inhibited the growth of bacterial and fungal strains. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of T.arjuna (bark) methanol extract was 500g/ml against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The MIC of B.monosperma (bark) methanol extract was 250g/ml against fungi. The phytochemical analysis of methanol extracts of T.arjuna and B.monosperma showed the presence of glycosides, flavinoids, steroids and tannins. T.arjuna and B.monosperma showed good antimicrobial activity. Conclusion:  It can be concluded that the methanol extract possesses potent bactericidal and fungicidal activity which in turn may be due to the presence of biologically active ingredients with antimicrobial activity in the medicinal plants.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:29.116Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:29.116Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb056d7b5ad7298c92f1","title":"Traditional Medicinal and Economic Uses of Gymnosperms of Dir (2009)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=86676F7B0830C939860A9190EAE45A2B?doi=10.1.1.820.8456&rank=65","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): The ethnobotanical data of four families of gymnosperms with 11 species were collected from Dir Kohistan Valleys.

Drosophila is one of the oldest andmost powerful genetic models and has led to novel insights into a variety of biological processes. Recently, Drosophila has emerged as a model system to study human diseases, including several important neurodegenerative diseases. Because of the genomic similarity betweenDrosophila and humans,Drosophilaneurodegenerative diseasemodels exhibit a variety of human-disease-like phenotypes, facilitating fast and cost-effective in vivo geneticmodifier screening and drug evaluation. Using these models, many disease-associated genetic factors have been identified, leading to the identification of compelling drug candidates. Recently, the safety and efficacy of traditional medicines for human diseases have been evaluated in various animal disease models. Despite the advantages of the Drosophilamodel, its usage in the evaluation of traditional medicines is only nascent. Here, we introduce theDrosophilamodel for neurodegenerative diseases and some examples demonstrating the successful application of Drosophilamodels in the evaluation of traditional medicines. 1.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:40.694Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:40.694Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb106d7b5ad7298c92fe","title":"Traditional medicines in Africa: an appraisal of ten potent African medicinal plants","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=DFA8AE34A25553A342DB77ECD5949B85?doi=10.1.1.1057.5239&rank=78","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda):  The use of medicinal plants as a fundamental component of the African traditional healthcare system is perhaps the oldest and the most assorted of all therapeutic systems.

Kampo medicine is the Japanese adaptation of traditional medicine. In Kampo medicine, “medical interview ” plays an important role. “Medical interview ” in Japanese traditional medicine includes not only chief complaint but also a questionnaire that asked about the patient’s lifestyle and subjective symptoms. The diagnosis by Kampo is called “Sho ” and determined by completely different view from Western medicine. Specialists gather all available information and decide “Sho. ” And this is the reason why non-Kampo specialists without technical knowledge have difficulties to use traditional medicine. We analyzed “medical interview” data to establish an indicator for non-Kampo specialist without technical knowledge to perform suitable traditional medicine. We predicted “Sho ” by using random forests algorithm which is powerful algorithm for classification. First, we use all the 2830 first-visit patients ’ data. The discriminant ratio of training data was perfect but that of test data is only 67.0%.

Even as a historian is not to sound evangelical, his views could and do change views and salvage threatened knowledge systems. In Igboland, the knowledge of traditional medicine is seriously threatened by the spate of condemnation it attracts from those who want to become more Catholic than the Pope. The spate of condemnation of African traditional medical practices are alarming and at best disturbing. This is because, the same people who would stop at nothing to buy Chinese made herbal drugs would condemn in its totality drugs made by local medical practitioners here in Nigeria. Rather than take the pains to study and understand the art involved in the profession and harness its potentials and more importantly preserve the knowledge therein, many obstacles are placed on the way of the traditional medicine men on account that they are “diabolic”, their products “ unhygienic” and unsafe to drink or a nuisance to human health. The present writers hold a contrary view as traditional medicine is a portent force in inter-group relations and very effective where orthodox medicine has failed. How true the latter statement is to be demonstrated in how two brands of traditional medicine-Odiette and Akpaballa have helped in cementing relationships between the Igbo and Igala especially as it concerns their health and security. Lessons from the experience of these groups would go a long way in fostering peace in the nation especially now that there are several security threats to its citizens.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:40.694Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:40.694Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb1d6d7b5ad7298c9302","title":"Original: English/French REPORT OF THE IBC ON TRADITIONAL MEDICINE SYSTEMS AND THEIR ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS (2013)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=558F173386205AD9D2B13D51379C4AC0?doi=10.1.1.370.3190&rank=82","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): UNESCO’s International Bioethics Committee included the subject of traditional medicine in its work programme for 2010-2011.

It is, however, a challenge to find detailed information on the ritual use of palms, which are an inextricable part of African medicinal and spiritual systems. This work reviews ritual uses of palms within African ethnomedicine. We studied over 200 publications on uses of African palms and found information about ritual uses in 26 of them. At least 12 palm species in sub-Saharan Africa are involved in various ritual practices: Borassus aethiopum, Cocos nucifera, Dypsis canaliculata, D. fibrosa, D. pinnatifrons, Elaeis guineensis, Hyphaene coriacea, H. petersiana, Phoenix reclinata, Raphia farinifera, R. hookeri, and R. vinifera. In some rituals, palms play a central role as sacred objects, for example the seeds accompany oracles and palm leaves are used in offerings. In other cases, palms are added as a support to other powerful ingredients, for example palm oil used as a medium to blend and make coherent the healing mixture. A better understanding of the cultural context of medicinal use of palms is needed in order to obtain a more accurate and complete insight into palm-based traditional medicines.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:53.200Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:53.200Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb1d6d7b5ad7298c9305","title":"A Brief Review on Constipation in Persian and Chinese Traditional Medicine (2014)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=558F173386205AD9D2B13D51379C4AC0?doi=10.1.1.860.4873&rank=85","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Background and purpose: Cconstipation is recognized as a widespread digestive disorder that influences the quality of life of affected people.

Because of the signifi-cant progress in high-throughput technologies and mo-lecular biology, systems biology occupies an important place in research during the post-genome era. Methods: The characteristics of systems biology and its applicability to traditional medicine research have been discussed from three points of view: data and databases, network analysis and inference, and modeling and sys-tems prediction. Results: The existing databases are mostly associat-ed with medicinal herbs and their activities, but new databases reflecting clinical situations and platforms to extract, visualize and analyze data easily need to be constructed. Network pharmacology is a key element of systems biology, so addressing the multi-component, multi-target aspect of pharmacology is important. Stud-ies of network pharmacology highlight the drug target network and network target. Mathematical modeling and simulation are just in their infancy, but mathe-matical modeling of dynamic biological processes is a central aspect of systems biology. Computational sim-ulations allow structured systems and their functional properties to be understood and the effects of herbal medicines in clinical situations to be predicted.

Through its packaging design, jamu for women depict female body in the form of photographs and illustrations. The female body is constructed to be seen attractive and become the ideal body. The research aims to read the ideal female body on the packaging design of jamu and to reveal the ideology behind them. We analyzed the packaging designs of jamu related to the formation of female body produced by five major manufacturers of traditional medicine that have survived for at least three generations: Air Mancur, Sido Muncul, Jamu Jago, Nyonya Meneer and Jamu Iboe. This analysis uses Roland Barthes' semiotic theory that reveals the linguistic message, the denoted image and rhetoric of the image. Ideal body is still struggling around the stereotype that physically described as thin and also plump with the emphasise on slim waist, big hip and breast. In keeping with the Javanese philosophy, female body is identical to the nature. The construction of female body is closely related to social and cultural context. Through the object and the pose, female body is depicted as traditional and modern, natural and cultural. Key words: Female Body; Packaging Design; Traditional Medicine (Jamu). Introduction At the level of the individual, weight is turned from an incidental feature of a person into an identity. Being \"overweight\" becomes a numerically defined status as well as a marker of individual failure to regulate the body appropriate (Heyes, 2011: 170). Shaping the ideal body is important especially for women. In Javanese tradition there is a traditional medicine that is well known as a product for slimming named jamu. Jamu is traditional medicines that are made from plants, animal materials, mineral materials, extract or mixtures of these materials used for treating ailments or sicknesses based on experience and handed down through generations (Harmanto, 2007: 13). Besides treating sickness, jamu is used to maintain the beauty and health. It is believe that drinking jamu regularly can make the body fresh and healthy. Jamu is derived from ancient Javanese language jampi or usodo. The Javanese dictionary of herbs (primbon) mentions that there are four classifications of jamu based on usability: jalu usada, wanito usada, rarya usada, and triguna usada. Jalu usada is jamu for men's health and virility. Wanito usada is used to treat women's health and beauty including reproductive health, beauty, and postpartum care. Rarya usada is jamu for children to cure intestinal worms, cough, diarrhea. Triguna usada is jamu for all people who suffered common diseases such as dizziness, cough, flu, or vomiting (Trubus, 2010: 6). Among many kinds of jamu, this research is focused on jamu for women (wanito usada) in the form of powder that is used to shape female body. It is very interesting to find out how jamu as a health product places the image of women in their packaging. Uniquely, the image of women in photographs featuring women in many kinds of fashion, hair style, gesture or in illustrations that describing women naked or abstract have been used for more than decades. Jamu through packaging design seems distinguishing itself from other health products, especially medical drugs. We believe that jamu packaging designs have an important role to depict the ideal female body. The research aims to read the ideal female body on the packaging design of jamu and to reveal the ideology behind them. It can give a description about the culture and the construction of female body on the packaging design media.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:53.200Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:22:53.200Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb1d6d7b5ad7298c930a","title":"Original Article Antiviral Activity of Some Plants Used in Nepalese Traditional Medicine","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=558F173386205AD9D2B13D51379C4AC0?doi=10.1.1.355.9573&rank=90","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Methanolic extracts of 41 plant species belonging to 27 families used in the traditional medicine in Nepal have been investigated for in vitro antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and influenza virus A by dye uptake assay in the systems HSV-1/Vero cells and influenza virus A/MDCK cells.

However, it seemed that the modern medicines are far more popular than traditional ones especially in towns and cities. Although the respondents admitted to have heard and or witnessed some cases where some modern medicines proved failure but managed by traditional medicine, very few believed so. This could be attributed to a scenario that only a small proportion of the respondents grew in environments conducive for using traditional medicine.

In Ethiopia, up to 80% of the population use traditional medicine for primary health care. Studies on the current knowledge and practices of communities in the era of modern health care expansion are lacking. Therefore, this study is aimed at assessing the knowledge, attitude, and practice of traditional medicine among communities in Merawi town. Methods. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 403 residents of Merawi town. A systematic random sampling was used to select households. Data was collected through house to house interview. Results. 392 out of 403 questionnaires were analysed. Among the participants, 220 (56.1%) were female. The mean (±s.d.) age of the participants was 32.5 (±12.4) years. Nearly two-thirds, 241 (61.5%), of study participants have good knowledge about traditional medicines. Three-quarters of participants prefer modern medicine to traditional drugs. 70.9% of participants had the experience of personal use of traditional therapies. Conclusions. The population in Merawi has good knowledge with high acceptability and use of traditional medicine. The main reasons for high acceptability and practice were cultural acceptability, lesser cost, and good outcome of traditional medicine.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:15.847Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:15.847Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb3f6d7b5ad7298c9320","title":"Antioxidant capacity of Macaronesian traditional medicinal plants.

The major Chinese traditional medicine elements such as Yin-Yang and Five-element Theories are partially modeled here based on the fuzzy concepts. This model took advantage of fuzzy reasoning methods such as generalized modus pones (GMP) and t-norm operation to describe mother-son relations, restrictions, encroachments, and violations in Five-element Theory. Also this same method tries to describe Yin-Yang tendency, disease transmission through the laws of generation, and guiding treatment. Obviously, it is quite difficult to model traditional medicine due to its element complexity and wideness. But this paper focuses only on the implementation of fuzzy theory to certain aspects of traditional medicine and does not go much further. Hence, most of the fuzzy membership values used here are just assumed values only. This type of fuzzy model can really support the design of fuzzy-based expert systems in any traditional medicine domain.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:27.539Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:27.539Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb3f6d7b5ad7298c9321","title":"Medicinal plants used by traditional medicine practitioners for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and related conditions in (2010)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3D7573FCA7E9C9DD1F7D84A5E08529B4?doi=10.1.1.1047.8499&rank=113","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda):  a b s t r a c t Aim of the study: Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most difficult ailments to control in the world today. The emergence of drug resistant strains has made previously effective and affordable remedies less effective. This has made the search for new medicines from local traditional medicines urgent. The specific objectives of this study were to (1) identify plant species used in the treatment of TB, their methods of preparation and administration, (2) document TB recognition, and (3) document medicine processing and packaging practices by traditional medicine practitioners (TMPs). Methods: We interviewed 32 TMPs from the districts of Kamuli, Kisoro and Nakapiripirit using a guided questionnaire. Results: We documented 88 plant species used to treat TB. Seven of these, Eucalyptus spp., Warburgia salutaris (G. Bertol.) Chiov., Ocimum suave Willd., Zanthoxylum chalybeum Engl., Momordica foetida Schum., Persea americana Mill. and Acacia hockii De Wild. were mentioned by three or more TMPs. Medicines were prepared mostly as mixtures or infrequently as mono-preparations in dosage forms of decoctions and infusions. They were administered orally in variable doses over varying periods of time. The TMPs did not know how to preserve the medicines and packaged them in used water bottles. Almost all TMPs mentioned the most important signs by which TB is recognised. They also knew that TB was a contagious disease spread through poor hygiene and crowding. Conclusions: Local knowledge and practices of treating TB exist in the districts surveyed. This knowledge may be imperfect and TMPs appear to be still experimenting with which species to use to treat TB. There is need to screen among the species mentioned to determine those which are efficacious and safe. The technology of processing, packaging and preserving traditional medicines for the treatment of TB is very basic and needs improving. The TMPs appear to be playing a significant role in primary health care delivery and this lends further justification for the ongoing Uganda government efforts to integrate the allopathic and traditional medicine systems.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:27.539Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:27.539Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb3f6d7b5ad7298c9322","title":"TRADITIONAL MEDICINE AMONG THE RURAL FOLK OF MORENA DISTRICT MADHYA PRADESH (1991)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3D7573FCA7E9C9DD1F7D84A5E08529B4?doi=10.1.1.270.489&rank=114","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): ABSTRACT: The present study carried out in the rural areas of Morena district of Madhya Pradesh, concerns the traditional use of indigenous herbal medicines against various diseases.

Globally, about 20-80 percent of the world's population uses various forms of alternative medication and medicine. AIM: This study was carried out to assess the prevalence and socio-demographic determinants of combined orthodox and traditional medicine use among households in Imo State, Nigeria. Methodology: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted among 422 participants selected from households in communities from orlu, Imo State, using the multi stage random sampling. A semi-structured, pretested, interviewer administered questionnaire was used to collect information from the participants and data was analyzed using EPI INFO version 7.1. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The prevalence of traditional medicine use and orthodox and traditional medicine combination was 77.5% and 63.7% respectively. Most, (86.3%) of the participants preferred orthodox medicine over traditional medicine and their commonest reason for preference is that it was more effective, (68.2%). Socio-demographic and household characteristics that significantly influenced combined utilization of both when sick were; age, sex, marital status, educational status, occupation, household size, family size, death of an under-five in the last one year, and the cause of death of the under-five, (p=<0.05). Conclusion: Our study revealed high use of both traditional medicine and the combination of both. There is need to increase awareness especially to the target groups on the likely dangers associated with combined use of orthodox and traditional medicine.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:41.183Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:41.183Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb4d6d7b5ad7298c932a","title":"Potential of Traditional Medicinal Plants for Treat- ing Obesity: A","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=818E99C56FC21BA695AD2D1615A443F6?doi=10.1.1.1038.6272&rank=122","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda):  Abstract: Obesity is an important global health concern, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Modern methods of treatment, such as synthetic drugs and surgery, still have to be improved to show safety and efficacy. The main concerns with such treatments are the high costs and serious complications. As a result, there is great interest in the use of plant-based medicinal agents as an alternative therapy. This study aims to provide a review of the studies on accessible botanical sources for the treatment of obesity. Based on published studies, this review attempts to explain how these medicinal plants act in humans to cause weight loss, and which method of usage is safer and more efficient. Information was gathered from books, journals and electronic sources published in the period of 1991 to 2012. The medicinal plants studied can reduce weight through five basic mechanisms, including stimulating thermogenesis, lowering lipogenesis, enhancing lipolysis, suppressing appetite, and decreasing the absorption of lipids. Furthermore, consumption of reliable medicinal plant extracts in a single form and at an optimum dosage could be a safe treatment for obesity. However, based on reviews, some combinations of certain medicinal plants may result in either lower efficacy or cause unexpected sideeffects.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:41.183Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:41.183Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb4d6d7b5ad7298c932b","title":"Medicinal Plants used in Traditional Medicine by Rural Communities in Cross River State, Nigeria","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=818E99C56FC21BA695AD2D1615A443F6?doi=10.1.1.672.16&rank=123","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Information on medicinal plants and the activities of the traditional healers in Iko Ekperem/Owai, Etara/Eyeyeng and Biajua communities in Akamkpa, Ikom and Boki Local Government Areas of Cross River State respectively were investigated. The study shows that 60 different medicinal plants were used in traditional medicine in these communities with Piper guinensis, Alstonia boonei,Spondia mombin,and Okoubaka aubrevillei having frequencies of 8, 8, 7 and 6 respectively. A total of 35 different ailments were treated using 52 medicinal plants with stomach pain having the highest number (11) of medicinal plants, followed by cough with 9 medicinal plants.

Other plant parts used include stems (14), roots (21), fruits (9), seeds (36) and exudates/latex (8). The processing of traditional medicine involves grinding, pounding, chewing, boiling and roasting of the medicinal plants which are administered orally, topical, or by incision, excision and through enema. The study revealed that some conservation measures were adopted by the traditional herbalists to ensure the availability of these plant species at all times. Such measures include planting these plant species in home gardens which has the highest frequency of 10 followed by creation of sacred grooves with frequency of 7 and the lowest frequency of 4 were obtained for planting in the farmlands.

These may reflect adaptive mechanisms that do not operate in contemporary societies as they did in the human past. Effectiveness of ASC procedures in treating substance dependence is found in ethnomedical treatments of addiction, the addiction literature, Alcoholics Anony-mous, and the physiological effects of shamanistic practices. A review of shamanic therapeutic mechanisms illustrates their applicability to addressing the psychodynamics of drug addiction. The utility of natural ASC practices to reduce substance dependence problems is illustrated by clinical research on the treatment of drug dependence through the use of meditative practice and models of their psychobiological dynamics. Shamanistic practices induce the relaxation response, enhance theta-wave production, and stimulate endogenous opioid and serotonergic mechanisms and their mood elevating effects.

Northern Peru represents the center of the Andean “health axis, ” with roots going back to traditional practices of Cupisnique culture (1000 BC). For more than a decade of research, semistructured interviews were conducted with healers, collectors, and sellers of medicinal plants. In addition, bioassays were carried out to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of plants found.Most of the 510 species encountered were native to Peru (83%). Fifty percent of the plants used in colonial times have disappeared from the pharmacopoeia. Market vendors specialized either on common and exotic plants, plants for common ailments, and plants only used by healers or on plants withmagical purposes. Over 974 preparations with up to 29 different ingredients were used to treat 164 health conditions. Almost 65 % of the medicinal plants were applied in these mixtures. Antibacterial activity was confirmed in most plants used for infections. Twenty-four percent of the aqueous extracts and 76 % of the ethanolic extracts showed toxicity. Traditional preparation methods take this into account when choosing the appropriate solvent for the preparation of a remedy. The increasing demand for medicinal species did not increase the cultivation of medicinal plants. Most species are wild collected, causing doubts about the sustainability of trade. 1.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:41.183Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:41.183Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb4d6d7b5ad7298c9332","title":"AN EFFECTIVE TRADITIONAL MEDICINE FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA: CLINICAL DEMONSTRATION AND PRELIMINARY TOXICOLOGICAL EVALUATION (1990)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=818E99C56FC21BA695AD2D1615A443F6?doi=10.1.1.270.2529&rank=130","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): ABSTRACT: This clinical paper reports the investigations conducted on a traditional African anti-asthmatic formulations and evaluates its toxicological and phyto-chemical effects.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:41.183Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:41.183Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb4d6d7b5ad7298c9331","title":"TRADITIONAL MEDICINE DEVELOPMENT FOR MEDICAL AND DENTAL PRIMARY HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=818E99C56FC21BA695AD2D1615A443F6?doi=10.1.1.584.2839&rank=129","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Traditional African Medicine (TAM) is our socio-economic and socio-cultural heritage, servicing over 80 % of the populations in Africa.

Most plant extracts were found to be minimally cytotoxic, indicating that the compounds linked to an ethnomedical framework were relatively innocuous, and eleven crude extracts exhibited viral inhibition against both the strains. All extracts inhibited the enzymatic activity of viral neuraminidase and four extracts were also shown to act through the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) pathway. Moreover, the samples that acted through both HI and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) evidenced more than 90 % reduction in virus adsorption and penetration, thereby indicating potent action in the early stages of viral replication.

Eleven electronic databases and sixteen Korean journals were searched to August 2013 for RCTs of CAM therapies. Key study characteristics were extracted and risk of bias was assessed using theCochraneCollaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias.Results.Three hundred and sixty publicationsmet our inclusion criteria. Complementary and traditionalmedicineRCTs in the Korean literature emerged in the mid-1990s and increased in the mid-2000s.The most common CAM interventions include acupuncture (59.4%) and herbal medicine (8.3%). The largest proportion of trials evaluated CAM for musculoskeletal conditions (20.7%). Adequate methods of randomization were reported in 41.7 % of the RCTs, whereas only 8.3 % reported adequate allocation concealment. A low proportion of trials reported participant blinding (34.2%) and outcome assessor blinding (22.5%).Conclusions.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:53.581Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:23:53.581Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb596d7b5ad7298c933a","title":"Scientific Basis for Traditional Medicines in Renal Disease Ching-Yuang Lin*","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=92CBED57DCAAC6ECE44D89B659DA6706?doi=10.1.1.604.8778&rank=138","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Abstract: Cordyceps Sinensis (CS) is a parasitic fungus that has been used as a Chinese medi-cine for a long time in the treatment of nephritis.

For this the individual health worker should be able to co-ordinate, integrate and adopt his functions. This is basically required which is minutely discussed in this paper by the author. Health Communication has been defined as the study (and application) of communication parameters (levels, functions and methodologies) applied in health situations / contexts 1. Planning, organizing, staffing, directing / commanding, controlling, innovating / creating, decision making, leading, motivating, communicating and coordinating are widely accepted as basic elements in the management process 2, when applied in health situations, contexts and organizations from the health management process. Communication in health organizations operates at 4 basic levels: individual, interpersonal, group and organizational. Communication serves at least 3 primary functions: co – ordination, integration and adaptation. By combing these two analytic features into a 4 x 3 matrix, we get 12 combinations of level and type, each component contributing to the overall efficiency of the health – care delivery system 3. The individual level How a medical practitioner conducts himself is conditioned by the perspective he takes self – centred, 4 patient – centred or medical field – centred. 5 The individual physician will thus have to co-ordinate his activities in such a way that he ‘ manages ’ health – care delivery. If there is clear role – perception by the individual he is better able to coordinate his activities 6. A physician has to work with so many different kinds of people that a stable personality – state and a good value system are very necessary, for it is only then can it be gauged whether the individual has integrated within himself alternative choices between professional reputation and financial success; concern for patients and commitment to coast – containment; running a practice and practice management 7.

Rapid reduction in natural resources as a consequence to the expanded urbanization, global warming and reduced natural habitat posed a considerable threat to the sustainability of traditional medicine. Being completely dependent upon natural resources like herbs, minerals and animal products, traditional medicine would possibly rank first in order of extinction of heritage if an alternative way is not considered well in time. In reference to the use of animal products, Ayurveda presents some unique examples where animals are used without causing harm to them and so without posing a threat to their existence. In the current context, when natural resources are facing a threat to their existence, a revisit to these ideas may give us a new insight to refine our look at natural resources used in traditional medicine. 1.

Most traditional medical theories have a social and religious character and emphasize prevention and holistic features. Traditional medical practices are usually characterized by the healer's personal involvement, by secrecy and a reward system. Biomedical theory and practice show an almost opposite picture: asocial, irreligious, curative and organ-directed; professional detachment, public knowledge and -until recently -'free of charge'. It is suggested that local communities do not expect that basic health care will improve when traditional healers become integrated into the service. They ask instead for improvement of basic health care itself: more services with better access, more dedication and respect from doctors and nurses, more medicines and personnel. Fieldwork needs to be done at the community level to arrive at a better understanding and assessment of the community's opinion concerning a possible role of traditional medicine in basic health care. keywords traditional medicine, basic health care, primary health care, cooperation, quality of care, community perspective, Africa correspondence Sjaak van der Geest,","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:24:16.848Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:24:16.848Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb706d7b5ad7298c9350","title":"Review Article Significance of Kampo, Japanese Traditional Medicine, in the Treatment of Obesity: Basic and Clinical Evidence","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A82E57302E45711E3466B67AFCB7B4FC?doi=10.1.1.814.2639&rank=160","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Copyright © 2013 Jun-ichi Yamakawa et al.

The cause of obesity includes genetic and environmental factors, including cytokines derived from adipocytes (adipo-cytokines). Although drug therapy is available for obesity, it is highly risky. Our main focus in this review is on the traditional form of Japanese medicine, Kampo, in the treated of obesity. Two Kampo formulas, that is, bofutsushosan (防通散) and boiogito (防 己黄耆), are covered by the national health insurance in Japan for the treatment of obesity. Various issues related to their action mechanisms remain unsolved. Considering these, we described the results of basic experiments and presented clinical evidence and case reports on osteoarthritis as examples of clinical application of their two Kampo medicine. Traditional medicine is used not only for treatment but also for prevention. In clinical practice, it is of great importance to prove the efficacy of combinations of traditional medicine and Western medicine and the utility of traditional medicine in the attenuation of adverse effects of Western medicine. 1.

The contradiction between the development of traditional medicine and the protection of wild resources has already become the common concern of zoophilists, traditional medical professionals, economists, sociologists. We believe that to strengthen the identification for threatened animals, to prevent the circulation of them, and to seek fertile animals of corresponding bioactivities as substitutes are effective strategies to solve this problem. Methodology/Principal Findings: A powerful technique of DNA barcoding based on the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) was used to identify threatened animals of Bovidae and Cervidae, as well as their illegal adulterants (including 10 species and 47 specimens). Meanwhile, the microcalorimetric technique was used to characterize the differences of bio-responses when those animal specimens acted on model organism (Escherichia coli). We found that the COI gene could be used as a universal primer to identify threatened animals and illegal adulterants mentioned above. By analyzing 223 mitochondrial COI sequences, a 100 % identification success rate was achieved.

To study the effects, resources that can systematically describe the chemical compounds in medicinal materials are necessary. In recent years, numerous databases on medicinal materials and constituent compounds have been constructed. However, because these databases provide differing information and the sources of such information are unclear or difficult to verify, it is difficult to decide which database to use. Moreover, there is much overlapping information. The aim of this study was to construct a database of medicinal materials and chemical compounds in Northeast Asian traditional medicine (TM-MC), for which medicinal materials are listed in the Korean, Chinese, and Japanese pharmacopoeias and information on the compound names of medicinal materials can easily be confirmed online. Description: To provide information on the chemical compounds of medicinal materials, chromatography articles from MEDLINE and PubMed Central were searched. After chemical compounds of medicinal materials were extracted by manually investigating the full-text of articles, a database of information on about 14,000 compounds from 536 medicinal materials was built. The database also provides links to the articles from which each medicinal material and chemical compound were extracted. Conclusion: TM-MC database provides information on medicinal materials and their chemical compounds from chromatography articles in MEDLINE and PubMed Central.

The use of medicinal plants as a fundamental component of the African traditional healthcare system is perhaps the oldest and the most assorted of all therapeutic systems. In many parts of rural Africa, traditional healers prescribing medicinal plants are the most easily accessible and affordable health resource available to the local community and at times the only therapy that subsists. Nonetheless, there is still a paucity of updated comprehensive compilation of promising medicinal plants from the African continent. The major focus of the present review is to provide an updated overview of 10 promising medicinal plants from the African biodiversity which have short- as well as long-term potential to be developed as future phytopharmaceuticals to treat and/or manage panoply of infectious and chronic conditions. In this endeavour, key scientific databases have been probed to investigate trends in the rapidly increasing number of scientific publications on African traditional medicinal plants. Within the framework of enhancing the significance of traditional African medicinal plants, aspects such as traditional use, phytochemical profile, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies and also future challenges pertaining to the use of these plants have been explored. 1.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:24:28.380Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:24:28.380Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb7c6d7b5ad7298c9359","title":"Journal of Medicinal Plants Research Inflammatory suppressive effect of Benjakul, a Thai traditional medicine on intestinal epithelial cell line","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=BD2D3CE369FAEFA840D13769AB4D7DDD?doi=10.1.1.1035.4044&rank=169","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda):  Plants are important sources of new therapeutic agents.

The inhibition of TPA-induced EBV-EA was detected using the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot technique. The indirect IFA detected the expression/inhibition of EBV-EA-D (diffused EA antigen), whereas the Western blot technique detected the expression/inhibition of both EBV-EA-D and EA-R (restricted EA antigen).

I suggest in conclusion that programmes should primarily be less concerned with assessing the immediate practicalities of the proposed action and more concerned with an understanding of the social whole.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:24:39.992Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:24:39.992Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bb876d7b5ad7298c9362","title":"Research Article Chemical Composition and Validation of the Ethnopharmacological Reported Antimicrobial Activity of the Body Fat of Phrynops geoffroanus Used in Traditional Medicine","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F15C538B2BD642CE80A4690E1D60F36?doi=10.1.1.783.3323&rank=178","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Copyright © 2013 Diógenes de Queiroz Dias et al.

Despite its prevalence in traditional medical practices worldwide, research on this phenomenon has often been neglected in comparison to medicinal plant research. This review discusses some related aspects of the use of animal-based remedies in Latin America, identifies those species used as folk remedies, and discusses the implications of zootherapy for public health and biological conservation. The review of literature revealed that at least 584 animal species, distributed in 13 taxonomic categories, have been used in traditional medicine in region. The number of medicinal species catalogued was quite expansive and demonstrates the importance of zootherapy as an alternative mode of therapy in Latin America. Nevertheless, this number is certainly underestimated since the number of studies on the theme are very limited. Animals provide the raw materials for remedies prescribed clinically and are also used in the form of amulets and charms in magic-religious rituals and ceremonies. Zootherapeutic resources were used to treat different diseases. The medicinal fauna is largely based on wild animals, including some endangered species. Besides being influenced by cultural aspects, the relations between humans and biodiversity in the form of zootherapeutic practices are conditioned by the social and economic relations between humans themselves. Further ethnopharmacological studies are necessary to increase our understanding of the links between traditional uses of faunistic resources and conservation biology, public health policies, sustainable management of natural resources and bio-prospecting.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:25:04.885Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:25:04.885Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bba06d7b5ad7298c9370","title":"Research Article Why Urban Citizens in Developing Countries Use Traditional Medicines: The Case of Suriname (2013)","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=73D2EFB468F67934D7E1298F81BE0C2C?doi=10.1.1.808.9264&rank=192","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Preliminary in vitro studies have indicated that D. membranacea extracts exhibited high cytotoxic activity with several cancer cell lines, but the underlining mechanisms are far from clear. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of ethanolic and aqueous crude extracts from D. membranacea Pierre, and pure compound from D. membranacea Pierre, Dioscorealide B, on natural killer cells activity and on lymphocyte proliferation. Methods: Immunomodulatory activity was investigated using PBMCs from healthy donors. NK cells activity was performed by the chromium release assay using PBMCs as effector cells, and K562 cells line labelled with chromium as target cells. Lymphocyte proliferation was determined by 3H-thymidine uptake. The degree of activation was expressed as the stimulation index. Results: The crude ethanolic extracts of D. membranacea Pierre significantly stimulated NK cells activity against K562 cells line at lower concentrations of 10 and 100 ng/ml, but not at higher concentrations. The ethanolic extracts showed no observable effect on lymphocyte proliferation. The crude water extracts significantly increased NK cell activity at concentrations of 10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, 1 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml, and also activated lymphocyte proliferation at concentration of 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, 1 μg/ml, 5 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activity of RN in a well-characterized animal model of allergic asthma. Rats were sensitized with intraperitoneal (ip) ovalbumin (OVA) and alum, and then challenged with OVA aerosols. The asthma model rats were treated with RN; saline- and dexamethasone- (DXM-) treated rats served as normal and model controls. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cellular differential and the concentrations of sICAM-1, IL-4, IL-5, TNF-α, INF-γ, and IgE in serum were measured. Lung sections underwent histological analysis. The immunohistochemistry S-P method was used to measure the expression of ICAM-1 and HO-1 in the lung. RN significantly reduced the number of inflammatory cells in BALF and lung tissues, decreased sICAM-1, IL-4, IL-5, TNF-α, and IgE in serum, and increased serum INF-γ.

However, for the lack of an effective systematic approach, the research progress on the effective substances and pharmacological mechanism of action has been very slow. In this paper, by incorporating network biology, bioinformatics and chemoinformatics methods, an integrated approach was proposed to systematically investigate and explain the pharmacological mechanism of action and effective substances of TCM. This approach includes the following main steps: First, based on the known drug targets, network biology was used to screen out putative drug targets; Second, the molecular docking method was used to calculate whether the molecules from TCM and drug targets related to chronic kidney diseases (CKD) interact or not; Third, according to the result of molecular docking, natural product-target network, main component-target network and compound-target network were constructed; Finally, through analysis of network characteristics and literature mining, potential effective multi-components and their synergistic mechanism were putatively identified and uncovered. Bu-shen-Huo-xue formula (BSHX) which was frequently used for treating CKD, was used as the case to demonstrate reliability of our proposed approach. The results show that BSHX has the therapeutic effect by using multi-channel network regulation, such as regulating the coagulation and fibrinolytic balance, and the expression of inflammatory factors, inhibiting abnormal ECM accumulation.

Phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription5 (STAT5) was investigated using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. The thickness of growth plate was increased by KBS. BV/TV, Tb.Th, TbN, Conn.D, and total porosity were improved by KBS. Hepatic IGF-I mRNA and serum IGF-I levels were elevated by KBS. Phosphorylation of STAT5 was increased with administration of KBS. These results suggest that KBS would be helpful to children who are in retard for their age through the elevation of IGF-I.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:25:57.398Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:25:57.398Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bbd56d7b5ad7298c939c","title":"Antioxidant Activities of Uyaku (Lindera Strychnifolia) Leaf Extract: A Natural Extract Used in Traditional Medicine","link":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=FD9526740C34EE929D5F52440DBB547D?doi=10.1.1.273.9503&rank=236","abstract":"CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): to treat stomach and renal diseases, neuralgia, rheumatism, and aging.

Its wide distribution may have resulted in substantial intraspecific genetic diversity for the fungus, potentially creating variation in its medical value. To date, we know little about the intraspecific genetic diversity of P. umbellatus. Methodology/Principal Findings: The objective of this research was to assess genetic differences of P. umbellatus from geographically diverse regions of China based on nrDNA ITS and 28S rRNA (LSU, large subunit) sequences. Significant sequence variations in the ITS and LSU sequences were detected. All sclerotial samples were clustered into four clades based on phylogenetic analysis of ITS, LSU and a combined data set of both regions. Heterogeneity of ITS and LSU sequences was detected in 5 and 7 samples respectively. All clone sequences clustered into the same clade except for one LSU clone sequences (from Henan province) which clustered into two clades (Clade I and Clade II). Significant genetic divergence in P. umbellatus was observed and the genetic diversification was greater among sclerotial samples from Shaanxi, Henan and Gansu provinces than among other provinces. Polymorphism of ITS and LSU sequences indicated that in China, P. umbellatus may spread from a center (Shaanxi, Henan and Gansu province) to other regions.

ELISA HRP2 assay was used to evaluate the in vitro inhibitory activity of the extracts alone or in combination with chloroquine. Cytotoxicity was assessed on human HeLa cell line and reflected by the selectivity index. Methanolic extract of Acanthospermum hispidum exhibited a strong and a moderate inhibitory activity on the growth of Dd2 and 3D7 at 2.8 µg/ml and 9.2 µg/ml concentrations respectively with a selectivity index>10. The combination of the most active extract (methanolic extract of Acanthospermum hispidum) with chloroquine showed a synergistic interaction on both strains. The good selectivity index of Acanthospermum hispidum on HeLa cells reflects the safety of this plant.

The IC50 values for a chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) and a chloroquine- resistant (K1) strain of Plasmodium falciparum were 28.64 and 9.79 µg/mL, respectively. The inhibition percentage of the rodent parasite, Plasmodium berghei, on day 4 in mice was 77.9 % and IC50 value on Madin–Darby bovine kidney cells (MDBK cells) was 59.84 µg/mL. The total extract was subjected to a bioassay-guided fractionation protocol based on the in-vivo model which resulted in the isolation of an acetophenon (compound 1), one new sesquiterpenoid; naghibione (compound 2) and two known sesquiterpenoid derivatives (compounds 3, 4). Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR experiments and ESI-MS. All compounds were evaluated for in-vivo antiplasmodial effect and the results revealed that naghibione showed good suppression activity, inhibiting 68.1 % of the parasite growth.","createdAt":"2020-10-12T20:26:56.510Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T20:26:56.510Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f84bc106d7b5ad7298c93bc","title":"Eurasian Journal of Anthropology Eurasian J.

Aggravatingly, CKD is a major cause of catastrophic health expenditure. The costs of dialysis and transplantation consume up to 3% of the annual healthcare budget in high-income countries. Crucially, however, the onset and progression of CKD are often preventable. In 2020, the World Kidney Day campaign highlights the importance of preventive interventions—be it primary, secondary, or tertiary. This complementing article focuses on outlining and analyzing measures that can be implemented in every country to promote and advance CKD prevention. Primary prevention of kidney disease should focus on the modification of risk factors and addressing structural abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tracts, as well as exposure to environmental risk factors and nephrotoxins. In persons with pre-existing kidney disease, secondary prevention, including blood pressure optimization and glycemic control, should be the main goal of education and clinical interventions. In patients with advanced CKD, the management of comorbidities such as uremia and cardiovascular disease is a highly recommended preventative intervention to avoid or delay dialysis or kidney transplantation. Political efforts are needed to proliferate the preventive approach. While national policies and strategies for non-communicable diseases might be present in a country, specific policies directed toward education and awareness about CKD screening, management, and treatment are often lacking. Hence, there is an urgent need to increase awareness of the importance of preventive measures throughout populations, professionals, and policy makers.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:35.054Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:35.054Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f66430bcb676da180bbe445","title":"Involving systems thinking and implementation science in pharmacists’ emerging role to facilitate the safe and appropriate use of traditional and complementary medicines","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12960-020-00493-9","abstract":"The use of traditional and complementary medicines (TM/CMs) has become an increasingly popular part of healthcare and self-care practices across the world.

Pharmacists play an integral role in contributing to public health. Discussion about integrating TM/CMs into the professional practice of the pharmacist began over two decades ago. Nevertheless, TM/CMs are predominantly managed as “retail products” and are not integrated into pharmaceutical care and practice. While some isolated measures towards integration have been proposed, there remains no consensus on how to deliver pharmaceutical care in a coordinated, systematic manner. Systems thinking approaches are needed to formulate and implement strategies that change pharmacists’ practice related to TM/CMs. Such approaches will ultimately reduce risk, optimize patient care, and result in better health outcomes.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:35.054Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:35.054Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f66430bcb676da180bbe446","title":"A National Survey of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use for Treatment Among Asian-Americans","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10903-019-00936-z","abstract":"Asian Americans (AAs) are more likely to use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) compared to other race/ethnicities, yet previous studies have conflicting results.

Despite poor knowledge of their potential interactions and side effects, many patients use CAM. This justifies the need to identify what eHealth technologies are assisting in identifying potential 1) adverse drug interactions with CAM, 2) adverse CAM-CAM interactions or 3) standalone CAM adverse events or side effects.A scoping review was conducted to identify eHealth technologies assisting in identifying potential adverse interactions with CAM or standalone CAM adverse events or side effects, following Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage scoping review framework. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and AMED databases and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health website were systematically searched. Eligible articles had to have assessed or referenced an eHealth technology assisting in identifying potential one or more of the three aforementioned items. We placed no eligibility restrictions on type of eHealth technology.Searches identified 3467 items, of which 2763 were unique, and 2674 titles and abstracts were eliminated, leaving 89 full-text articles to be considered. Of those, 48 were not eligible, leaving a total of 41 articles eligible for review. From these 41 articles, 69 unique eHealth technologies meeting our eligibility criteria were identified. Themes which emerged from our analysis included the following: the lack of recent reviews of CAM-related healthcare information; a large number of databases; and the presence of government adverse drug/event surveillance.The present scoping review is the first, to our knowledge, to provide a descriptive map of the literature and eHealth technologies relating to our research question. We highlight that while an ample number of resources are available to healthcare providers, researchers, and patients, we caution that the quality and update frequency for many of these resources vary widely, and until formally assessed, remain unknown.

The current systematic review aims to identify potential pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions from the existing literature to ensure their effective and safe combination usage in cancer patients.A systematic search was conducted on nine major Chinese and English databases, including China Journal Net, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Ovid MEDLINE®, etc., to identify clinical, animal, and in-vitro studies that evaluate the effect of combined use of Lingzhi or Yunzhi with cytotoxic drugs. The Jadad scale was used to assess the quality of clinical studies.This search identified 213 studies, including 77 clinical studies that reported on the combined use of cytotoxic drugs with Yunzhi (n = 56) or Lingzhi (n = 21). Majority of these clinical studies demonstrated modest methodological quality. In clinical practice, the most commonly used cytotoxic drugs with Lingzhi were cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and paclitaxel, whereas Tegafur/uracil (UFT)/Tegafur, 5-FU, and mitomycin were the ones used more often with Yunzhi. Only two clinical pharmacokinetic studies were available showing no significant interactions between Polysaccharide K (PSK) and Tegafur. From the pharmacodynamic interactions perspective, combination uses of Yunzhi/Lingzhi with cytotoxic drugs in clinical practice could lead to improvement in survival (n = 31) and quality of life (n = 17), reduction in tumor lesions (n = 22), immune modulation (n = 38), and alleviation of chemotherapy-related side effects (n = 14) with no reported adverse effects.Our findings suggest that the clinical combination use of Lingzhi or Yunzhi with cytotoxic drugs could enhance the efficacy and ameliorate the adverse effects of cytotoxic drugs, leading to improved quality of life in cancer patients. More high quality clinical studies including pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions studies are warranted to verify these observations and mechanisms involved. Based on the high quality clinical data, pharmacoepidemiology methods and bioinformatics or data mining could be adopt for further identification of clinical meaningful herb-drug interactions in cancer therapies.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:35.055Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:35.055Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f66430bcb676da180bbe44a","title":"Food-drug interaction and pharmacokinetic study between fruit extract of Capsicum frutescens L. and glimepiride in diabetic rats","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40816-020-00191-y","abstract":"The present study was designed to explore the food-drug and pharmacokinetic interaction between C.frutescens, a culinary herb on hypoglycemic activity of glimepiride, a sulfonyl urea derivative used in the treatment of type-2 diabetes) in diabetic rats in combination of each as single doses for one day.

The US Drug Enforcement Agency considers it a ‘drug of concern’, and the US FDA is reviewing kratom, but there is a paucity of information regarding health effects. Liver injury is often cited as a potential health consequence, however the same few case reports are repeatedly referenced, without a broader context. Furthermore, reports have largely lacked standardized causality assessment methods. The objective is to evaluate causality in kratom liver injury, through a comprehensive scoping review of human cases, and by reviewing epidemiologic, animal, and mechanistic reports that relate to kratom liver injury. Hepatotoxicity causality was systematically examined using the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) for case reports. Biopsy findings, potential pathophysiologic mechanisms, and management options are discussed. This review identified 26 case reports and abstracts, in addition to 7 cases reported from the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network, 25 in FDA databases, and 27 in internet user forums. Latency periods to symptom onset had a median of 20.6&nbsp;days and mean of 21&nbsp;days (range 2–49). Common presenting signs and symptoms were abdominal discomfort, jaundice, pruritis, and dark urine. Histologic findings were predominantly cholestatic, although, biochemically, the condition was heterogenous or mixed; the median R ratio was 3.4 and the mean was 4.6 (range 0.24–10.4). Kratom likely causes liver injury based on the totality of low-quality human evidence, and, in the context of epidemiologic, animal, and mechanistic studies. It remains unclear which subgroups of users are at heightened risk.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:35.055Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:35.055Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f66430bcb676da180bbe454","title":"Potential herb–drug interactions in community-dwelling older adults in China: the Shanghai Aging Study","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40520-020-01489-0","abstract":"Potential herb–drug interactions (pHDIs) often go unrecognized, and little is known about the prevalence of pHDIs in older adults.This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of pHDIs in community-dwelling older adults in Shanghai and identify patterns and factors associated with pHDIs.Baseline data from the Shanghai Aging Study, which was designed to establish a prospective community-based cohort of older adults in Shanghai, were analyzed regarding pHDIs with Lexi-Interact Online software.Among 1227 participants who used any combination of drug–herb or herb–herb, 43.3% were exposed to at least one pHDI.

There is limited evidence surrounding T&CM use and disclosure by indigenous patients. Our aim was to explore healthcare providers’ views about usage, disclosure/non-disclosure of T&CM by Indigenous cancer patients.Semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 18 healthcare providers, including three indigenous providers, at a large urban hospital providing care to Indigenous cancer patients were conducted to explore providers’ experiences and attitudes towards T&CM use by Indigenous cancer patients. An interpretive phenomenological approach was used to thematically analyse the data.Analysis revealed six themes: concern about risk; no ‘real’ benefits; perception of T&CM and conventional medicine as antithetical; barriers to disclosure; ‘patients’ choice’ a double-edged sword; and providers’ lack of knowledge about T&CM. Healthcare providers perceived discord between T&CM and conventional medicine. Most lacked knowledge of T&CM, and had concerns around negative-interactions with conventional treatments. They considered T&CM outside their role, citing this as reasoning for their lack of knowledge. Indigenous healthcare providers had greater understanding and openness towards T&CM.Given the potential usage of T&CM by Indigenous cancer patients, providers need a more comprehensive understanding of T&CM in order to inform discussion and facilitate effective disclosure on this topic. If indigenous Australians with cancer feel that cancer care providers are unreceptive to discussing T&CM, patient care risks being compromised; particularly given the potential for negative interactions between T&CM and conventional cancer treatments.

During the long-term mixed lifestyle, the knowledge of traditional medicinal plants in different communities has been assimilated to some extent. Therefore, this paper is based on ethnobotanical investigations to document traditional medicinal plants used by local people and discuss the differences between the Yi and Han communities in the study area.Data on traditional medicinal plants were collected from September 2016 to August 2017 in the Yi autonomous county of Jingdong. Seven townships and 16 villages were selected for the field investigations. Information was obtained through key informant interviews. A total of 44 key informants were interviewed, and all of them were herbalists or herbal sellers.In this study, a total of 302 traditional medicinal plant species belonging to 117 families and 252 genera were investigated and documented, most of which were obtained from herbalists. Although family Asteraceae was the most prevalent, with 27 species, the most commonly utilized species were members of family Papaveraceae, Dactylicapnos scandens (D. Don) Hutch., which is used as an antipyretic drug. Herbs comprised half of the total number of species, and the whole plant is the most frequently utilized plant part. The plants were used to treat more than 93 human diseases, with antipyretic drugs being the most common form of herbal medicine. The traditional medicinal plants used in the study area possess a high ratio of being documented in the literature. According to the analysis, the Chinese Pharmacopoeia recorded 76 species and the Resources of Traditional Chinese Medicine recorded 233 species of traditional medicinal plants. By evaluating the endangered status of the traditional medicinal plants in the study area, we found good conservation status of the cited medicinal plants. Regarding the similarity between the communities, there were significant differences between the Yi and Han communities, as indicated by the Jaccard similarity index (0.232).Medicinal plants are the embodiment of wisdom from our ancestors and play a significant role in treating various human disorders. As one of the birthplaces of Yi medicine, the study area possesses a high species diversity of traditional medicinal plants used by local people. With the rapid development of modern medicine, however, the inheritance of this valuable culture is facing enormous threats even though its potential value has not yet been fully explored. Therefore, some effective protection measures should be taken, and some modern techniques should be implemented to prove the safety and improve the scientific acceptance of the traditional medicinal plants.","year":"2019","createdAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:57.453Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:57.453Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f664321cb676da180bbe47e","title":"Data integration of electronic medical record under administrative decentralization of medical insurance and healthcare in China: a case study","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13584-019-0293-9","abstract":"In most regions of China, Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems in hospitals are developed in an uncoordinated manner. Medical Insurance and Healthcare Administration are localised and organizations gather data from a functional management viewpoint without consideration of wider information sharing. Discontinuity of data resources is serious. Despite the government’s repeated emphasis on EMR data integration, little progress has been made, causing inconvenience to patients, but also significantly hindering data mining.This exploratory investigation used a case study to identify bottlenecks of data integration and proposes countermeasures. Interviews were carried out with 27 practitioners from central and provincial governments, hospitals, and related enterprises in China. This research shows that EMR data collection without patients’ authorization poses a major hazard to data integration. In addition, non-uniform information standards and hospitals’ unwillingness to share data are also significant obstacles to integration. Moreover, friction caused by the administrative decentralization, as well as unsustainability of public finance investment, also hinders the integration of data resources.To solve these problems, first, a protocol should be adopted for multi-stakeholder participation in data collection. Administrative authorities should then co-establish information standards and a data audit mechanism. Finally, measures are proposed for expanding data integration for multiplying effectiveness and adopting the Public-Private Partnerships model.","year":"2019","createdAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:57.453Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:57.453Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f664321cb676da180bbe47c","title":"ALOHA: developing an interactive graph-based visualization for dietary supplement knowledge graph through user-centered design","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12911-019-0857-1","abstract":"Dietary supplements (DSs) are widely used. However, consumers know little about the safety and efficacy of DSs. There is a growing interest in accessing health information online; however, health information, especially online information on DSs, is scattered with varying levels of quality. In our previous work, we prototyped a web application, ALOHA, with interactive graph-based visualization to facilitate consumers’ browsing of the integrated DIetary Supplement Knowledge base (iDISK) curated from scientific resources, following an iterative user-centered design (UCD) process.Following UCD principles, we carried out two design iterations to enrich the functionalities of ALOHA and enhance its usability. For each iteration, we conducted a usability assessment and design session with a focus group of 8–10 participants and evaluated the usability with a modified System Usability Scale (SUS). Through thematic analysis, we summarized the identified usability issues and conducted a heuristic evaluation to map them to the Gerhardt-Powals’ cognitive engineering principles. We derived suggested improvements from each of the usability assessment session and enhanced ALOHA accordingly in the next design iteration.The SUS score in the second design iteration decreased to 52.2 ± 11.0 from 63.75 ± 7.2 in our original work, possibly due to the high number of new functionalities we introduced. By refining existing functionalities to make the user interface simpler, the SUS score increased to 64.4 ± 7.2 in the third design iteration. All participants agreed that such an application is urgently needed to address the gaps in how DS information is currently organized and consumed online. Moreover, most participants thought that the graph-based visualization in ALOHA is a creative and visually appealing format to obtain health information.In this study, we improved a novel interactive visualization platform, ALOHA, for the general public to obtain DS-related information through two UCD design iterations. The lessons learned from the two design iterations could serve as a guide to further enhance ALOHA and the development of other knowledge graph-based applications. Our study also showed that graph-based interactive visualization is a novel and acceptable approach to end-users who are interested in seeking online health information of various domains.","year":"2019","createdAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:57.453Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-19T17:42:57.453Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f671f6b06f4ff6a6816a7b5","title":"Critical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-herb interactions in rats between warfarin and pomegranate peel or guava leaves extracts","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12906-019-2436-5","abstract":"In-depth information of potential drug-herb interactions between warfarin and herbal compounds with suspected anticoagulant blood thinning effects is needed to raise caution of concomitant administration. The current study aimed to investigate the impact of co-administration of pomegranate peel and guava leaves extracts, including their quality markers namely; ellagic acid and quercetin, respectively, on warfarin’s in vivo dynamic activity and pharmacokinetic actions, in addition to potential in vitro cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) inhibition.Influence of mentioned extracts and their key constituents on warfarin pharmacodynamic and kinetic actions and CYP activity were evaluated. The pharmacodynamic interactions were studied in Sprague Dawley rats through prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) measurements, while pharmacokinetic interactions were detected in vivo using a validated HPLC method. Furthermore, potential involvement in CYP inhibition was also investigated in vitro on isolated primary rat hepatocytes.Preparations of pomegranate peel guava leaf extract, ellagic acid and quercetin in combination with warfarin were found to exert further significant increase on PT and INR values (p < 0.01) than when used alone (p < 0.05). Pomegranate peel extract showed insignificant effects on warfarin pharmacokinetics (p > 0.05), however, its constituent, namely, ellagic acid significantly increased warfarin Cmax (p < 0.05). Guava leaves extract and quercetin resulted in significant increase in warfarin Cmax when compared to control (p < 0.01). Furthermore, guava leaves extract showed a significant effect on changing the AUC, CL and Vz. Significant reduction in CYP2C8, 2C9, and 3A4 was seen upon concomitant use of warfarin with ellagic acid, guava leaves and quercetin, unlike pomegranate that insignificantly affected CYP activities.All combinations enhanced the anticoagulant activity of warfarin as the results of in vivo and in vitro studies were consistent. The current investigation confirmed serious drug herb interactions between warfarin and pomegranate peel or guava leaf extracts. Such results might conclude a high risk of bleeding from the co-administration of the investigated herbal drugs with warfarin therapy.

Good ART adherence is required to achieve these benefits. We investigated how the environmental, social, economic and behavioural experiences of people living with HIV with poor viral suppression could explain their non-adherence to long term ART.This qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted in Uganda between September 2015 and April 2016. Thirty individuals on ART for 5&nbsp;years or more (10 on first line and 20 on second line), with poor viral suppression, were randomly selected from a cohort of people living with HIV on ART. In-depth interviews about ART; awareness, adherence counselling, obstacles to daily adherence and regimen switches were conducted. Emerging themes from the interviews transcripts and field notes were identified and thematic content analysis done. Participants’ consent, compensation, confidentiality and study ethical approvals were ensured.We found that poor adherence to long term ART was due to: travel for work or social activities, stigma, receiving little or no continuous ART adherence education, alcohol consumption and use of alternative ‘HIV cure’ medicines. Other reasons included; ART side effects, treatment fatigue, belief that long-term ART or God can ‘cure HIV’, and&nbsp;food security.Achieving optimal ART benefits requires continuous provision of ART adherence education to individuals on long term ART. This helps them overcome the challenges related to living with HIV: worries of food insecurity, alcohol misuse, economic hardship, and beliefs in HIV cures and use of unproven alternative HIV treatments. People living with HIV who travel require adherence support and larger quantities of ART refills to cover their time away.","year":"2019","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:22:51.039Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:22:51.039Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6726f130a723a79f094dc8","title":"Co-delivery of 5-Fluorouracil and Curcumin Nanohybrid Formulations for Improved Chemotherapy Against Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12663-018-1126-z","abstract":"The chemotherapeutics agent, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and curcumin (Cur), a natural antioxidant, has a wide pharmacological window to treat oral carcinoma; however, both drugs have limited bioavailability.

Although nevirapine is not currently recommended in initial anti-HIV regimens, its use remains consistent in a certain number of HIV-1-positive subjects. Thus, our aim was to determine clinical and genetic factors involved in the development of severe nevirapine induced liver toxicity.We retrospectively analyzed all HIV positive patients who were followed at the Infectious Diseases Unit, DIBIC Luigi Sacco, University of Milan from May 2011 to December 2015. All patients treated with nevirapine who underwent a genotyping for the functional variants mapping into ABCB1, CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes were included in the analysis. Severe hepatotoxicity was defined as ACTG grade 3–4 AST/ALT increase during the first three months of nevirapine treatment. The causality assessment between NVP exposure and drug-induced liver injury was performed by using the updated Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Methods. Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was tested by χ2 test. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed using a backward elimination method.Three hundred and sixty-two patients were included in the analysis, of which 8 (2.2%) experienced a severe liver toxicity. We observed no differences between patients with and without liver toxicity as regards gender, ethnicity, age and immune-virological status. A higher prevalence of HCV coinfection (75.0% vs 30.2%; p = .0013) and higher baseline AST (58&nbsp;IU/L vs 26&nbsp;IU/L; p = 0.041) and ALT (82&nbsp;IU/L vs 27&nbsp;IU/L; p = 0.047) median levels were observed in patients with liver toxicity vs those without toxicity. The genotypes CT/TT at ABCB1 rs1045642 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), showed a protective effect for liver toxicity when compared with genotype CC (OR = 0.18, 95%CI 0.04–0.76; p = 0.020) in univariate analysis. In the multivariate model, HCV coinfection was independently associated with higher risk of developing liver toxicity (aOR = 8.00, 95%CI 1.27–50.29; p = 0.027), whereas ABCB1 rs1045642 CT/TT genotypes (aOR = 0.10, 95%CI 0.02–0.47; p = 0.004) was associated with a lower risk.According to our findings HCV coinfection and ABCB1 rs1045642 SNP represent independent determinants of severe liver toxicity related to nevirapine.

Emerging evidence suggests that Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) can be beneficial for various mental health issues. However, little is known about the prevalence, reasons, and associated factors of CAM use among this population in the U.S. The purpose of this study is to examine the characteristics of CAM use among U.S. children with mental health issues.Utilizing the 2012 National Health Interview Survey data, we used descriptive analysis, Wald F-statistics, and multivariable survey logistic regression models to examine the prevalence, patterns, and associated factors of CAM use in children aged 4–17 (n = 10,233) adjusting for the complex sampling design.CAM use is more popular among children with mental health issues compared with those without (19.2% vs. 10.1%, p < 0.001). Herbal remedies (9.1%), mind-body therapies (5.5%), and chiropractic care (5.3%) were the most frequently used modalities. Primary reasons for children to use CAM are because they are helpful (69.2%), natural (55.9%), and holistic (44.7%). The majority of CAM users perceived CAM therapies are helpful. Predictors of CAM use are children who are female, whose parents had a higher educational level and socioeconomic status, and who had at least one co-morbid medical condition. Only 18.4% of CAM usage was recommended by medical doctors.Approximately 10 million parents of children with mental health issues reported the use of CAM therapies, mainly because of their desire for a more natural and holistic healthcare approach. Given that the majority of CAM users perceived CAM therapies as helpful, future studies should investigate the unique contributions of CAM in pediatric psychiatric care. Because a low percentage of CAM use was recommended by medical doctors, educational interventions designed to equip medical professionals with CAM knowledge and experience will be conducive to improving effective patient-physician communication in clinical settings. Since CAM use is reported as more prevalent by parents’ of children with higher education and family income, effective strategies designed to reduce disparities in accessing promising CAM therapies are warranted.","year":"2018","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:54:57.775Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:54:57.775Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6726f130a723a79f094dcd","title":"Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Why is the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) Still Used 25&nbsp;Years After Its Launch?","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40264-018-0654-2","abstract":"Launched in 1993 and partially based on the results of an international consensus meeting organized under the auspices of the Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS), the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) is the most used causality assessment tool worldwide for the diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and herb-induced liver injury (HILI) in a large number of epidemiological studies, case reports, and case series. The 25-year experience of RUCAM use confirmed that the success was due to its objective, standardized, and liver-injury-specific approach structured with defined key elements derived from a series of DILI cases with positive rechallenge. Using this series, the validation procedure avoided arbitrary definitions and confirmed scores to key items. The algorithm provides a quantitative causality grading of highly probable, probable, possible, unlikely, or excluded relationship between the liver injury and the suspected product(s). Despite challenges, prospective use of RUCAM fosters case data completeness and transparent causality adjudication in real time, as opposed to subjective opinion resulting from several rounds by experts lacking defined key elements and scores. In 2016, RUCAM was updated with specification of alcohol use and Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) biomarkers and simplified item handling to further reduce inter-observer variability. RUCAM-based probable and highly probable DILI and HILI cases are essential for the detection of new hepatotoxins, confirmation of new biomarkers, description of clinical features and risk factors, and determination of incidence in pharmacoepidemiological studies.

Anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, neuroprotective and vascular protective effect of herbal medicines are believed to be efficacious in stroke treatment. Herbs typically have fewer reported side effects than allopathic medicine, and may be safer to use over longer period of time. Herbal medicines are believed to be more effective for the longstanding health complaints, such as stroke. Several medicinal plants and their active constituents show the promising results in laboratory research. However failure in transformation of laboratory animal research to the clinical trials has created huge challenge for the use of herbal medicine in stroke. Until and unless scientifically comprehensive evidence of the efficacy and safety of herbal medicine in ischemic stroke patients is available, efforts should be made to continue implementing treatment strategies of proven effectiveness. More consideration should be paid to natural compounds that can have extensive therapeutic time windows, perfect pharmacological targets with few side effects. Herbal medicine has excellent prospective for the treatment of ischemic stroke, but a lot of effort should be invested to transform the success of animal research to human use.","year":"2018","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:03.917Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:03.917Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6726f730a723a79f094dd3","title":"Safety and Tolerability of Intravenous Valproic Acid in Healthy Subjects: A Phase I Dose-Escalation Trial","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40262-017-0553-1","abstract":"Valproic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has beneficial effects in the setting of cancer, neurologic diseases, and traumatic injuries.

The elderly patients, however, are burdened by comorbid conditions, polypharmacy, and altered functional status. With increasing use of complementary and alternative medicine in our elderly patients with IBD, it is vital for the provider to provide counsel on drug-herb potential interactions. CAM includes herbal products, diet, dietary supplements, acupuncture, and prayer. In this paper, we will review common CAM, specifically herbs, that are used in patients with IBD including the herb background, suggested use, evidence in IBD, and most importantly, potential interactions with IBD medications used in elderly patients.

This paper aimed to systematically summarise the evidence of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) interventions on stroke modifiable risk factors for stroke prevention.A literature search was conducted via the MEDLINE, CINAHL/EBSCO, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Database from 1996 to 2016. Randomised controlled trials or cross-over studies were included. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.A total of 46 trials (6895 participants) were identified regarding the use of CHM interventions in the management of stroke risk factors, including 12 trials for hypertension, 10 trials for diabetes, eight trials for hyperlipidemia, seven trials for impaired glucose tolerance, three trials for obesity, and six trials for combined risk factors. Amongst the included trials with diverse study design, an intervention of CHM as a supplement to biomedicine and/or a lifestyle intervention was found to be more effective in lowering blood pressure, decreasing blood glucose level, helping impaired glucose tolerance reverse to normal, and/or reducing body weight compared to CHM monotherapy. While no trial reported deaths amongst the CHM groups, some papers do report moderate adverse effects associated with CHM use. However, the findings of such beneficial effects of CHM should be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneous set of complex CHM studied, the various control interventions employed, the use of different participants’ inclusion criteria, and low methodological quality across the published studies. The risk of bias of trials identified was largely unclear in the domains of selection bias and detection bias across the included studies.This study showed substantial evidence of varied CHM interventions improving the stroke modifiable risk factors. More rigorous research examining the use of CHM products for sole or multiple major stroke risk factors are warranted.","year":"2017","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:07.935Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:07.935Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6726fb30a723a79f094ddc","title":"Community pharmacists’ knowledge, practices and beliefs about complementary and alternative medicine in Palestine: a cross-sectional study","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12906-017-1940-8","abstract":"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) utilization is dramatically increasing among patients.

Cytotoxicity was examined using XTT assays in cisplatin-sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, A2780CisR), and non-cancer kidney cells (HEK-293). The effect of the selected herbs on carboplatin and paclitaxel cytotoxicity was tested as well. Pro-apoptotic effects were tested using Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Of 98 patients referred to the CIM service, 42 (42.9%) reported using/intending to use herbal products during chemotherapy. European mistletoe and ginger exhibited significant anti-cancer activity in cisplatin-sensitive and resistant ovarian cells. Wheatgrass and ephedra reduced cytotoxicity of carboplatin on cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cells, while ginger, European and Oriental mistletoe increased chemosensitivity in both cancer cell lines. Wheatgrass, European mistletoe, and ginger increased sensitivity to cisplatin-resistant cells treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel. No effect was observed with the addition of any of the herbs on non-cancerous embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293). Herbal medicine use by patients with ovarian cancer may influence anti-cancer activity of chemotherapy. Integrative physicians can provide “bedside-to-bench” guidance on the safety of these products.","year":"2017","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:13.720Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:13.720Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67270130a723a79f094dec","title":"Imaging of autoimmune hepatitis and overlap syndromes","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00261-016-1019-x","abstract":"Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an uncommon, chronic inflammatory, and relapsing liver disease of unknown origin that may lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, or death.

These “other” practitioners have been referred to as “unconventional”, “alternative” and “complementary”, among other terms throughout the past half century.This study investigates the discourses surrounding the changes in the terms, and their meanings, used to describe unconventional medicine in North America. Terms identified by the literature as synonymous to unconventional medicine were searched using the Scopus database. A textual analysis following the method described by Kripendorff 2013 was subsequently performed on the five most highly-cited unconventional medicine-related peer-reviewed literature published between 1970 and 2013.Five commonly-used, unconventional medicine-related terms were identified. Authors using “complementary and alternative”, “complementary”, “alternative”, or “unconventional” tended to define them by what they are not (e.g., therapies not taught/used in conventional medicine, therapy demands not met by conventional medicine, and therapies that lack research on safety, efficacy and effectiveness). Authors defined “integrated/integrative” medicine by what it is (e.g., a new model of healthcare, the combining of both conventional and unconventional therapies, accounting for the whole person, and preventative maintenance of health). Authors who defined terms by “what is not” stressed that the purpose of conducting research in this area was solely to create knowledge. Comparatively, authors who defined terms by “what is” sought to advocate for the evidence-based combination of unconventional and conventional medicines. Both author groups used scientific rhetoric to define unconventional medical practices.This emergence of two groups of authors who used two different sets of terms to refer to the concept of “unconventional medicine” may explain why some journals, practitioner associations and research/practice centres may choose to use both “what is not” and “what is” terms in their discourse to attract interest from both groups. Since each of the two groups of terms (and authors who use them) has different meanings and goals, the evolution of this discourse will continue to be an interesting phenomenon to explore in the future.","year":"2016","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:17.135Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:17.135Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67270530a723a79f094df3","title":"Consumption of medicinal plants by patients with heart diseases at a pharmacist-managed anticoagulation clinic in Brazil","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11096-016-0270-0","abstract":" Background Medicinal plants (MP) have been used for many years with the purpose of feeding and curing.

The most commonly used medications were metformin, insulin, and enalapril. Among the patients, 237 (59.3&nbsp;%) were using 395 medicinal herbs. The most commonly used herbs were sage, anise and peppermint. In 51 out of the 237 cases (21.5&nbsp;%) at least one potential drug-herb interaction was found. Male patients were more likely to have potential drug-herb interactions. Patients with potential drug herb interactions were older, having a higher mean number of chronic diseases and medications (P-value < 0.05). Only 133 out of 237 (56.1&nbsp;%) users told their prescribers or pharmacists before using medicinal herbs.Use of medicinal herbs is a common practice among Palestinian patients attending primary healthcare centers. A substantial proportion failed to disclose to their doctors or pharmacists about herbal products they used, therefore, the physicians and pharmacists are recommended to ask patients about the use of medicinal herbs to avoid any possible negative outcomes. Better counseling and communication between patients and healthcare providers is recommended.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:22.919Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:22.919Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67270a30a723a79f094e00","title":"What has been overlooked on study of Chinese materia medica in the West?","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11655-015-2081-x","abstract":"Chinese materia medica (CMM), including Chinese herbal, animal, and mineral medicine, has been widely researched in the past century for their biological and pharmacological activities. However, their mechanism and clinical efficacy studies did not always give expected results. For example, the most commonly used Chinese herb for menstrual disorders, Radix Angelicae sinensis, showed neither estrogenic nor progesteronic activity in laboratory and clinical studies. Its efficacy should not be denied simply based on such results, because it is mostly used together with other herbs in formulae. Moreover, its regulation on menstruation may take effect through other mechanisms, such as regulation of blood circulation. The key difference of Chinese medicine (CM) from conventional medicine is its unique holistic view on human body and diseases. CMM is mostly applied in clinic in the form of formulae. Study on individual CMM, simply using methods for development of conventional drugs, is unable to thoroughly reveal the power of CMM formulae. The reason may partly result from improper design due to the lack understanding about application principle of CMMs in CM, and/or to current lack of knowledge about the causes of some symptoms and diseases. This paper will introduce the importance of qi and blood in CM etiology and pathology, Zheng differentiation, formulation of CMMs, and explain why one formula can treat different diseases and one disease can be treated with different formulae. Examples in the paper will demonstrate that proper studies on Zheng and its corresponding clinically proven formulae could help scientists find new direction to explain and treat symptoms and diseases that so far modern medicine has been unable to, provided that the designer properly understands CM theories, etiology and pathology of CM, as well as modern medicine. Strategy suggestions about research methods for CMM and its formulae will be given at the end.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:22.919Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:22.919Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67270e30a723a79f094e01","title":"Views and experiences of healthcare professionals towards the use of African traditional, complementary and alternative medicines among patients with HIV infection: the case of eThekwini health district, South Africa","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12906-015-0687-3","abstract":"Many patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection use traditional, complementary, and alternative medicines and other practices to combat the disease, with some also using prescribed antiretroviral therapy provided by the public health sector.

PBF was determined using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Demographic data and anthropometric variables were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the performance of anthropometric measures as predictors of obesity. One-hundred men and 100 women were recruited for this study. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-stature ratio (WSR) were significantly correlated to PBF. BMI demonstrated the best performance according to the area under the ROC curves in both sexes at cut-off points of 22.5 in women or 25&nbsp;kg/m2 in men. WC and WSR showed better performance than WHR to detect obesity. In conclusion, anthropometric indices in young Thai adults were correlated well with PBF to predict obesity as shown in prior reports. Different cut-off points of these indices to define obesity in young Thai adults are recommended. The global cut-off points of WSR in women regardless of ethnicity are supported.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:26.338Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:26.338Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67270e30a723a79f094e0a","title":"Use of herbal medicine during pregnancy among women with access to public healthcare in Nairobi, Kenya: a cross-sectional survey","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1472-6882-14-432","abstract":"Maternal health is a public health priority in many African countries, but little is known about herbal medicine use in pregnancy.

Only 12.5% of users disclosed such use to healthcare professionals, and about 20% used herbal medicine concomitantly with Western medicine for the same illness/condition. Women used herbal medicine for back pain, toothache, indigestion and infectious diseases, such as respiratory tract infections and malaria. A proportion of users took herbal medicine only to boost or maintain health. There were high rates of self-prescribing, as well as sourcing from family and friends. Beliefs about safety and efficacy were consistent with patterns of use or non-use, although both users and non-users were unsure about the safety and contraindications of Western medicine during pregnancy compared with that of herbal medicine.Herbal medicine is used by 12% of pregnant women with access to healthcare in an urban context in Kenya, and often occurs without the knowledge of healthcare practitioners. Healthcare professionals should play a role in rational use of both herbal and Western medicine, by discussing contraindications and the potential for drug-herb interactions with patients.

At 30 and 150&nbsp;mg/kg TAE dosages, an increase in liver CYP2E1 and CYP3A1 enzyme activity were observed. Moreover, the mRNA levels of CYP2E1 and CYP3A1 in the rat liver, lung, and intestine were significantly up-regulated with TAE from 6 and 30&nbsp;mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, treatment with TAE (150&nbsp;mg/kg) enhanced the activities and the mRNA levels of CYP1A2 and CYP2C11 in rats. However, the activity or mRNA level of CYP2D1 remained unchanged.These results suggest that TAE-induced CYPs activity in the rat liver results from the elevated mRNA levels of CYPs. Co-administration of prescriptions containing YHS should consider a potential herb (drug)–drug interaction mediated by the induction of CYP2E1 and CYP3A1 enzymes.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:32.249Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:32.249Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67271430a723a79f094e10","title":"New Oral Anticoagulants in Practice: Pharmacological and Practical Considerations","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40256-013-0061-0","abstract":"Although highly effective, warfarin use is complicated by its unpredictable narrow therapeutic window, genetic heterogeneity in pharmacokinetic response, numerous food and drug interactions, and the need for regular international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring. Currently, several novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) drugs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) are available on the market as alternatives to warfarin. These agents all feature more predictable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties than warfarin. Additionally, the NOACs do not require routine monitoring of coagulation parameters, and have a relatively lower potential for interactions with drug, herb, and dietary constituents, which enhances the convenience of management for both patients and health professionals alike. However, there are other considerations regarding the use of NOACs that must be taken into account during management of therapy. In contrast to warfarin, most NOACs need dosage adjustments in renal impairment and are contraindicated in severe liver impairment, and there are no specific antidotes for treating NOAC-related over-anticoagulation. The more frequent dosing needed for NOACs may reduce adherence, especially in elderly patients with polypharmacy. Furthermore, NOACs, especially dabigatran, are not as well tolerated as warfarin in patients with gastrointestinal diseases. Overall, the availability of the NOACs has expanded the treatment armamentarium, but they are not without risk. Given the limited experience with the NOACs, their limited range of indications, and their cost, the characteristics of each anticoagulant must be carefully considered to carefully select the agent that will provide the optimal risk/benefit profile in the individual patient.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:32.249Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:32.249Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67271430a723a79f094e11","title":"Management of Hepatic Encephalopathy","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11940-014-0297-2","abstract":"Hepatic encephalopathy management varies depending on the acuity of liver failure. However, in patients with either acute or chronic liver failure five basic steps in management are critical: stabilization, addressing modifiable precipitating factors, lowering blood ammonia, managing elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) (if present), and managing complications of liver failure that can contribute to encephalopathy, particularly hyponatremia. Because liver failure patients are prone to a variety of other medical problems that can lead to encephalopathy (such as coagulopathy associated intracranial hemorrhage, electrolyte disarray, renal failure, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and infection), a thorough history, physical and neurologic examination is mandated in all encephalopathic liver failure patients. There should be a low threshold for brain imaging in patients with focal neurological deficits given the propensity for spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. In patients with acute liver failure and high grade encephalopathy, identification of the etiology of acute liver failure is essential to guide treatment and antidote administration, particularly in the case of acetaminophen poisoning. Equally critical is management of elevated ICP in acute liver failure. Intracranial hypertension can be treated with hypertonic saline and/or adjustment of the dialysis bath. Placement of an intracranial monitor to guide ICP therapy is risky because of concomitant coagulopathy and remains controversial. Continuous renal replacement therapy may help lower serum ammonia, treat coexisting uremia, and improve symptoms. Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for patients with acute liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hepatic encephalopathy, lactulose and rifaxamin remain a mainstay of therapy. In these patients, it is essential to identify reversible causes of hepatic encephalopathy such as increased ammonia production and/or decreased clearance (eg, infection, GI bleed, constipation, hypokalemia, dehydration). Chronic hyponatremia should be managed by gradual sodium correction of no more than 8‒12&nbsp;meq/L per day to avoid central myelinolysis syndrome. Free water restriction and increased dietary sodium are reasonable, cost effective treatment options. Many emerging therapies, both pharmacologic and interventional, are currently being studied to improve management of hepatic encephalopathy.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:32.249Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:32.249Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67271430a723a79f094e12","title":"Identification and evaluation of drug–supplement interactions in Hungarian hospital patients","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11096-014-9923-z","abstract":" Background The increasing number of patients taking supplementary products together with prescribed medicines has become a new challenge for health care systems. These products may influence therapy outcomes by inducing unwanted effects. Particularly concerning is the potential for harmful interactions between prescribed medicines and supplementary products. Objective The aims of the study were to evaluate supplement use, to identify and analyse potential interactions, and to assess the efficiency of computerised interaction screening. Setting Participants of the study were inpatients and outpatients of a Hungarian university hospital. Method A cross-sectional point-of-care survey of 200 patients was carried out. Data was collected through personal interviews and a review of the medical records. Drug–drug, drug–supplement and supplement–supplement interactions were analysed with three interaction databases (Lexi-Interact Online, Medscape Drug Interaction Checker and Mediris). Main outcome measure Prevalence of supplementary product use, number of medicines and supplementary products per patient, procurement sources of products, number of potentially severe interactions. Results There was a marked difference between data obtained from patient interviews and the medical records. 85.5&nbsp;% of the surveyed patients took supplementary products during the 2&nbsp;weeks prior to the interview. The average number of prescribed medicines and supplementary products were 7.8 and 2.5, respectively. Women were more likely to take supplements than men. There was no significant difference in supplement use between patients under or over 60&nbsp;years, between inpatients and outpatients and among patients in various wards. 39.4&nbsp;% of supplementary products were purchased outside a regulated pharmacy environment. Potentially severe drug–supplement interactions were detected with 45.2&nbsp;% of supplement users; however the majority of interactions were not included in one or the other of the three databases. In addition to that the risk ratings of the same interactions varied greatly between databases. Conclusion A significant number of patients are exposed to potential drug interactions with supplementary products; however interagreement among interaction databases is poor. Our data suggest that a full medication history should specifically address the intake of supplements.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:32.249Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:32.249Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67271730a723a79f094e14","title":"Acupuncture for patients with mild hypertension: study protocol of an open-label multicenter randomized controlled trial","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1745-6215-14-380","abstract":"Several studies using acupuncture to treat essential hypertension have been carried out.

In general, older people are more prone to adverse drug events which can result from potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) use and drug–drug interactions (DDIs). Objective This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of PIM use and DDIs among elderly nursing home residents in Macao, and to find out the factors associated with these drug-related problems. Setting This study was conducted in the largest nursing home in Macao, with a bed capacity of 168. Method All data of this cross-sectional study were collected from medical charts and medication administration records. PIM use was determined by the screening tool of older person’s prescription (STOPP) criteria and potential DDIs were detected using the preset criteria of two compendia, Drug-Reax and Lexi-Interact. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent factors associated with each drug-related problem.

Latent class analyses were used to detect use (propensity) and intensity of use among users of all three product types. Associations between social and health covariates and product patterns were examined using linear and multinomial logit regression procedures.Three latent classes of health product use were identified. The largest (43%) was characterized by a high probability of PM and NHP but not OTC use. Class two (37%), in contrast, had a low probability of using any of the three health products. Class three (20%) had a high probability of PM and OTC but not NHP use. Age, gender, immigrant status, household size, co-morbidity, perceived health status, and having a regular doctor were associated with these patterns of use. Analyses of intensity of product use among users revealed seven distinct classes; these were differentiated by age, household size, co-morbidity and weight (BMI status).If defining polypharmacy or polyherbacy is based simply on number of health products used, then for Canadians under age 80 neither practice appeared to be widespread. More work needs to be done to define the “poly” in polypharmacy and polyherbacy.

Research indicates that homeopathic remedies (a) contain measurable source and silica nanoparticles heterogeneously dispersed in colloidal solution; (b) act by modulating biological function of the allostatic stress response network (c) evoke biphasic actions on living systems via organism-dependent adaptive and endogenously amplified effects; (d) improve systemic resilience.The proposed active components of homeopathic remedies are nanoparticles of source substance in water-based colloidal solution, not bulk-form drugs. Nanoparticles have unique biological and physico-chemical properties, including increased catalytic reactivity, protein and DNA adsorption, bioavailability, dose-sparing, electromagnetic, and quantum effects different from bulk-form materials. Trituration and/or liquid succussions during classical remedy preparation create “top-down” nanostructures. Plants can biosynthesize remedy-templated silica nanostructures. Nanoparticles stimulate hormesis, a beneficial low-dose adaptive response. Homeopathic remedies prescribed in low doses spaced intermittently over time act as biological signals that stimulate the organism’s allostatic biological stress response network, evoking nonlinear modulatory, self-organizing change. Potential mechanisms include time-dependent sensitization (TDS), a type of adaptive plasticity/metaplasticity involving progressive amplification of host responses, which reverse direction and oscillate at physiological limits. To mobilize hormesis and TDS, the remedy must be appraised as a salient, but low level, novel threat, stressor, or homeostatic disruption for the whole organism. Silica nanoparticles adsorb remedy source and amplify effects. Properly-timed remedy dosing elicits disease-primed compensatory reversal in direction of maladaptive dynamics of the allostatic network, thus promoting resilience and recovery from disease.Homeopathic remedies are proposed as source nanoparticles that mobilize hormesis and time-dependent sensitization via non-pharmacological effects on specific biological adaptive and amplification mechanisms. The nanoparticle nature of remedies would distinguish them from conventional bulk drugs in structure, morphology, and functional properties. Outcomes would depend upon the ability of the organism to respond to the remedy as a novel stressor or heterotypic biological threat, initiating reversals of cumulative, cross-adapted biological maladaptations underlying disease in the allostatic stress response network. Systemic resilience would improve. This model provides a foundation for theory-driven research on the role of nanomaterials in living systems, mechanisms of homeopathic remedy actions and translational uses in nanomedicine.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:41.632Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:41.632Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67271d30a723a79f094e23","title":"Community Pharmacists role in obesity treatment in Kuwait: a cross-sectional study","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-12-863","abstract":"Obesity is a growing health concern in Kuwait.

The most anticipated barriers to obesity counseling were lack of patient awareness about pharmacists' expertise in counseling 76.2% (95% CI: 69.7-81.7) and pharmacists’ opinions that obese patients lack willpower and are non-adherent to weight reduction interventions 71.8% (95% CI: 65.1-77.8).Strengths, weaknesses and barriers related to obesity counseling by pharmacists in Kuwait were identified, and suggestions were provided to strengthen that role.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:41.632Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:41.632Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67271d30a723a79f094e24","title":"Herbal medicine: a survey of use in Nigerian presurgical patients booked for ambulatory anaesthesia","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1472-6882-12-130","abstract":"Utilization of herbal medicines in the preoperative period by Nigerian patients booked for day case surgery has not been explored.Cross-sectional survey of 60 patients presenting for day-case surgery at a tertiary healthcare institution over a 3-week period in August 2011 was conducted. Using a structured questionnaire, inquiries were made concerning use of herbal medicines in the immediate preoperative period. Socio-demographic characteristics, information on use of concurrent medical prescriptions, types of herbs used, reasons for use, perceived side effects and perceived efficacy were obtained. Data were evaluated using descriptive statistics and Chi-square.Fifty-two (86.7%) were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 1 while 8 (13%) were ASA 2. Most patients (86.7%) had their procedures done under local infiltration with monitored anaesthesia care (MAC), while 5.0% and 8.3% had their procedures done under regional and general anaesthesia, respectively. About 48.3% of respondents were on concurrent medical prescriptions while 51.7% were not. Forty percent (40%) of patients admitted to use of herbal medicine, all by the oral route, in the immediate perioperative period; 87.5% did not inform their doctor of their herbal use. Types of herbs used included ‘dogonyaro’, ‘agbo’, ‘nchanwu’, and Tahitian noni. Treatment of malaria was commonest reason for use in 29.2% of patients, while cough and concurrent surgical condition were reasons given by 12.5% of patients, respectively. Seventy-nine percent (79.2%) of patients considered their herbal medications effective. Perceived side effects of herbal medication (16.6%) included fever, waist pain and intoxication. There were no variations in use between ASA 1 and ASA 2 patients and none between respondents on conventional medication against those that were not. Variables such as age less than 35 years, female gender, being married and being an urban dweller did not show any significant difference in use.This survey revealed many patients were on one or more herbal preparations in the immediate preoperative period. In consideration of possible untoward drug interactions between conventional medication, herbal preparations and anaesthesia, doctors (especially anaesthetists) should routinely assess all patients booked to be anaesthetized, especially those for day case surgery. The authors recommend surveys with larger respondent numbers to determine prevalence of use and possible interactions between indigenous Nigerian herbs and anaesthesia.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:41.632Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:41.632Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67271d30a723a79f094e26","title":"Dispensing practice in the community pharmacies in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11096-011-9605-z","abstract":" Background Good Pharmacy Practice is the process of supplying the accurate drug to the right patient for an adequate period of time with the lowest cost to the patient and the community.

The recently approved oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, along with the emerging oral anti-factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, have been developed to address many of the shortcomings of warfarin therapy. As warfarin is associated with extensive food and drug interactions, there is also a need to consider such interactions with the new oral anticoagulants. While to date few drug and dietary interactions have been reported with the new oral anticoagulants, it is still early in their development and clinical use cycle. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles will have to be closely accounted for when determining the likelihood of a potential drug interaction prior to therapy initiation. As the list of drugs and supplements that interact with warfarin is continuously expanding, and the knowledge on drug interactions with the novel oral anticoagulants is still in its infancy, clinicians need to be vigilant when initiating any of these agents or when any changes in the patient’s medication profile occur and perform a close screening for potential drug and dietary interactions.

Nevertheless, medical practitioners were the most popular source of information. From the multivariate analysis, variables associated with CAM use were: professional employment, time since the last natural menses, use of CAM for conditions other than menopause, and presence of some severe symptoms.The relatively high prevalence of CAM use by women transitioning through menopause should encourage research initiatives into determining which CAM treatments are the safest and effective. The increasing and likely concomitant use of CAM with HRT and other pharmaceuticals underlines the need for the implementation of a surveillance system to report and monitor possible drug-herb adverse events. The discrepancy between women preferring to seek information about CAM from their medical doctor and the difficulties noted in communication between doctor and patient should encourage educational initiatives on CAM by health-care agencies and institutions.","year":"2010","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:50.395Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:50.395Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67272630a723a79f094e36","title":"Attitude and use of herbal medicines among pregnant women in Nigeria","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1472-6882-9-53","abstract":"The use of herbal medicines among pregnant women in Nigeria has not been widely studied.Opinion of 595 pregnant women in three geopolitical zones in Nigeria on the use of herbal medicines, safety on usage, knowledge of potential effects of herbal remedies on the fetus and potential benefits or harms that may be derived from combining herbal remedies with conventional therapies were obtained using a structured questionnaire between September 2007 and March 2008.

Many drugs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Objective: To establish whether allelic variation in CYP polymorphic genes contributes to variability in drug response and unexpected toxicity. Methods: A case-control study was conducted. The cases consisted of patients with drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DI-ILD; n = 59). Two control groups were used: one group of healthy volunteers (n = 173) and one group of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; n = 110). Results: Of the patients with DI-ILD 91.5% (54/59) had at least one of the studied variant genes compared with 70.5% (122/173, p < 0.001) of the healthy volunteers and 69.1% (76/110, p < 0.001) of the IPF patients.

In order to provide accurate information on drug safety and to promote the reporting of adverse drug reactions, in 1999 the clinical section of the Italian Society of Pharmacology created the website www.farmacovigilanza.org, financially supported by a non-profit foundation. The website promptly and independently provides news published in the international literature on drug safety, translated into Italian. The site also contains specific sections dedicated to adverse reactions to herbal products and cosmetic preparations. Objectives: The aim of this paper was to describe the number and characteristics of users and the most intensively visited sections of the website. Furthermore, in September 2006, 300 registered users who had accessed a registered users area aimed specifically at health professionals more than 20 times in the preceding 12 months received a ten-item multiple choice questionnaire via e-mail, to assess satisfaction with the accuracy and promptness of information provided, text comprehension and other information sources for drug-related issues. We hereby describe the results of the survey, after careful analysis of the questionnaires. Results: Up until July 2007, the site had over 600 000 direct accesses and 9760 healthcare professionals registered to use the site. A total of 108 responses to the e-mailed questionnaire were received (response rate = 36%), of which 103 were analysed; five were excluded due to missing information. Overall, the majority of responders judged the information on the site as objective and understandable. More than 85% of participants declared that the site has influenced their opinion and attitudes toward the safety of medicines. In particular, responders said that they pay more attention to drug interactions and to the safety profile of newly marketed drugs, and spend more time on communicating the risks of drugs used by their patients. Specifically, responders stated that they pay more attention to drug interactions (87.7%), newly marketed drugs (68.5%), herbal remedies (56.2%), drugs in patients at increased risk (42.5%), drugs in pregnant women (42.5%) and cosmetics (13.7%). Conclusions: The website www.farmacovigilanza.org appears to be an effective tool that provides users of the site with independent, relevant and reliable safety information. It was found to influence (and possibly improve) the quality of prescribing of a large proportion of the general practitioners who responded to our questionnaire, and our results indicate a high appreciation of the information found on the website. Moreover, the survey disclosed that there is a substantial need for such information in the national language by healthcare professionals. We think that our approach can serve as a model for similar initiatives in countries elsewhere in the world.","year":"2013","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:53.777Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:55:53.777Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67272930a723a79f094e42","title":"Acute-on-chronic liver failure: consensus recommendations of the Asian Pacific Association for the study of the liver (APASL)","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12072-008-9106-x","abstract":"The Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) set up a working party on acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) in 2004, with a mandate to develop consensus guidelines on various aspects of ACLF relevant to disease patterns and clinical practice in the Asia-Pacific region.

Clinical decision support tools (CDSTs) have proven beneficial in selecting treatment options to improve outcomes. However, there is a dearth of information on the abilities of CDSTs, such as drug information databases. This study evaluated online drug information databases when answering infectious disease-specific queries.Eight subscription drug information databases: American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information (AHFS), Clinical Pharmacology (CP), Epocrates Online Premium (EOP), Facts & Comparisons 4.0 Online (FC), Lexi-Comp (LC), Lexi-Comp with AHFS (LC-AHFS), Micromedex (MM), and PEPID PDC (PPDC) and six freely accessible: DailyMed (DM), DIOne (DIO), Epocrates Online Free (EOF), Internet Drug Index (IDI), Johns Hopkins ABX Guide (JHAG), and Medscape Drug Reference (MDR) were evaluated for their scope (presence of an answer) and completeness (on a 3-point scale) in answering 147 infectious disease-specific questions. Questions were divided among five classifications: antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiparasitic, and vaccination/immunization. Classifications were further divided into categories (e.g., dosage, administration, emerging resistance, synergy, and spectrum of activity). Databases were ranked based on scope and completeness scores. ANOVA and Chi-square were used to determine differences between individual databases and between subscription and free databases.Scope scores revealed three discrete tiers of database performance: Tier 1 (82-77%), Tier 2 (73-65%) and Tier 3 (56-41%) which were significantly different from each other (p < 0.05). The top tier performers: MM (82%), MDR (81%), LC-AHFS (81%), AHFS (78%), and CP (77%) answered significantly more questions compared to other databases (p < 0.05). Top databases for completeness were: MM (97%), DM (96%), IDI (95%), and MDR (95%). Subscription databases performed better than free databases in all categories (p = 0.03). Databases suffered from 37 erroneous answers for an overall error rate of 1.8%.Drug information databases used in ID practice as CDSTs can be valuable resources.

However, there are documented interactions between SJW and prescription medications including warfarin, cyclosporine, indinavir, and oral contraceptives. One source of information about these safety considerations is the product label. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinically relevant safety information included on labeling in a nationally representative sample of SJW products from the USA.Eight clinically relevant safety issues were identified: drug interactions (SJW-HIV medications, SJW-immunosupressants, SJW-oral contraceptives, and SJW-warfarin), contraindications (bipolar disorder), therapeutic duplication (antidepressants), and general considerations (phototoxicity and advice to consult a healthcare professional (HCP)). A list of SJW products was identified to assess their labels. Percentages and totals were used to present findings.Of the seventy-four products evaluated, no product label provided information for all 8 evaluation criteria. Three products (4.1%) provided information on 7 of the 8 criteria. Four products provided no safety information whatsoever. Percentage of products with label information was: SJW-HIV (8.1%), SJW-immunosupressants (5.4%), SJW-OCPs (8.1%), SJW-warfarin (5.4%), bipolar (1.4%), antidepressants (23.0%), phototoxicity (51.4%), and consult HCP (87.8%). Other safety-related information on labels included warnings about pregnancy (74.3%), lactation (64.9%), discontinue if adverse reaction (23.0%), and not for use in patients under 18 years old (13.5%). The average number of a priori safety issues included on a product label was 1.91 (range 0–8) for 23.9% completeness.The vast majority of SJW products fail to adequately address clinically relevant safety issues on their labeling. A few products do provide an acceptable amount of information on clinically relevant safety issues which could enhance the quality of counseling by HCPs and health store clerks.

Therefore, accurate models of predicting metabolic herb-drug interactions would be useful tools in efforts to avoid toxic adverse events. However, the majority of pharmacokinetic interactions listed for herbal medicinal products are based on theoretical predictions of the in vitro pharmacological effects of known constituents, which do not necessarily have to be the active ingredients. The prediction of herb-drug interactions is further complicated by the fact that pharmacokinetic data on active or (at least) known ingredients are often not available. The present article discusses the potential of pharmacokinetic profiling for detecting herb-drug interactions, using the most frequently cited interactions in the literature as examples. In particular, common mechanisms of herb-drug interactions are summarized, and the available experimental methods for detecting such interactions, as well as the limitations of these models, are critically evaluated. In addition, we discuss the question of whether the existing methods of detecting herb-drug interactions correlate with the clinical relevance. Effective screening tools that accurately predict metabolic herb-drug interactions would offer a tremendous advantage because it is not possible to study all potential herb-drug interactions in clinical trials.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:00.354Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:00.354Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67273030a723a79f094e4a","title":"Natural health products and cancer chemotherapy and radiation therapy","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12156-008-0028-6","abstract":"Complementary therapies, notably natural health products such as herbs and vitamins, are frequently used by cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Comorbid depression can complicate the presentation, clinical course, and response to treatment of patients with chronic pain. The literature reviewed herein focuses on treatment approaches applicable to chronic, nonmalignant pain states predominantly. Although antidepressants offer advantages in simultaneously producing pain relief and mitigating depression, not all antidepressants share equal efficacy; those with noradrenergic and serotonergic influences seem to fare better than agents with single neurotransmitter influences.

The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between different clinical factors and outcomes of warfarin therapy in Hong Kong Chinese patients.Methods: The study was conducted at the anticoagulation clinic of the Prince of Wales Hospital from 1 April to 31 December 2003. Clinical data collected included demographics, indications of warfarin, dietary vitamin K consumption, and drug-drug interactions. Blood samples were obtained for the genetic polymorphism analysis of CYP 2C9. Linear and multiple regression analysis were used for statistical analysis to determine the correlation between variables and the importance of various factors as the determinants of warfarin dosage requirement.Results: A total of 63 patients were recruited. The mean warfarin dosage was 3.30 ± 2.23 mg/day. The warfarin dosage ranged from 0.75 to 12 mg/day. The mean age was 59 ± 14 years old. Age, dietary vitamin K consumption, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, smoking and drinking status were found to be factors statistically significant affecting warfarin dosage. We detected no single nucleotide polymorphism in CYP 2C9 exon 4.Conclusion: Age, dietary vitamin K consumption, warfarin indication for atrial fibrillation, co-morbid with CHF, smoking and drinking status were found to be the factors that affected the warfarin requirement in Hong Kong Chinese patients. However, the genetic polymorphism in exon 4 of CYP 2C9 may not be associated with the warfarin sensitivity in this patient population.","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:13.962Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:13.962Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67273d30a723a79f094e65","title":"Concomitant drug, dietary, and lifestyle issues in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving anticoagulation therapy for stroke prophylaxis","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11936-005-0052-9","abstract":"Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia and the leading risk factor for stroke. In those at moderate to high risk of stroke, oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist) significantly reduces not only the frequency of such events but also their severity and the associated risk of death. However, achieving optimal anticoagulation with this agent is clinically challenging in view of its complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. In this regard, concomitant drug therapy (both prescription and over-the-counter medications, including herbal products, vitamins, and various nutritional supplements), along with alcohol intake, dietary factors, and changes in lifestyle, can significantly affect anticoagulation control and thereby expose patients to the risk of bleeding or thromboembolic complications (due to over- and underanticoagulation, respectively). Therefore, it is recommended that intensified monitoring of anticoagulation be performed at initiation and discontinuation of concomitant drug therapy, and in the case of significant dietary and lifestyle changes. Moreover, many patients receive inadequate education and are unaware of such risks and their implications, highlighting the need for better awareness and education on this important aspect of anticoagulation therapy.","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:13.962Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:13.962Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67273d30a723a79f094e66","title":"African herbal medicines in the treatment of HIV: Hypoxis and Sutherlandia.

The prevalence of herbal use among primary care patients varies in previous studies; the pattern of herbal use among urban racially/ethnically diverse primary care patients has not been widely studied. The primary objectives of this study were to describe the use of herbs by ethnically diverse primary care patients in a large metropolitan area and to examine factors associated with such use. The secondary objective was to investigate perceptions about and patterns of herbal use.Data for a cross-sectional survey were collected at primary care practices affiliated with the Southern Primary-care Urban Research Network (SPUR-Net) in Houston, Texas, from September 2002 to March 2003. To participate in the study, patients had to be at least 18 years of age and visiting one of the SPUR-Net clinics for routine, nonacute care. Survey questions were available in both English and Spanish.A total of 322 patients who had complete information on race/ethnicity were included in the analysis. Overall, 36% of the surveyed patients (n = 322) indicated use of herbs, with wide variability among ethnic groups: 50% of Hispanics, 50% of Asians, 41% of Whites, and 22% of African-Americans. Significant factors associated with an individual's herbal use were ethnicity other than African-American, having an immigrant family history, and reporting herbal use by other family members. About 40% of survey respondents believed that taking prescription medications and herbal medicines together was more effective than taking either alone. One-third of herbal users reported using herbs on a daily basis. More Whites (67%) disclosed their herbal use to their health-care providers than did African-Americans (45%), Hispanics (31%), or Asians (31%).Racial/ethnic differences in herbal use were apparent among this sample of urban multiethnic adult primary care patients. Associated factors of herbal use were non-African-American ethnicity, immigrant family history, and herbal use among family members. Whereas Hispanics and Asians reported the highest rates of herbal use, they were the least likely to disclose their use to health-care professionals. These findings are important for ensuring medication safety in primary care practices.","year":"2004","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:19.322Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:19.322Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67274330a723a79f094e6d","title":"Discrepant views of oncologists and cancer patients on complementary/alternative medicine","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00520-004-0677-3","abstract":"Complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) is widely used by patients but rarely discussed with oncologists.

Our aim was to examine the use of mind-body therapies, using data available from a national survey. DESIGN: Analysis of a large nationally representative dataset that comprehensively evaluated the use of mind-body therapies in the last year. SETTING: United States households. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2,055 American adults in 1997–1998. INTERVENTIONS: Random national telephone survey. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: We obtained a 60% weighted overall response rate among eligible respondents. We found that 18.9% of adults had used at least 1 mind-body therapy in the last year, with 20.5% of these therapies involving visits to a mind-body professional. Meditation, imagery, and yoga were the most commonly used techniques. Factors independently and positively associated with the use of mind-body therapies in the last year were being 40 to 49 years old (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33 to 3.10), being not married (AOR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.34 to 2.36), having an educational level of college or greater (AOR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.57 to 3.09), having used self-prayer for a medical concern (AOR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.87 to 3.42), and having used another complementary medicine therapy in the last year (AOR, 3.77; 95% CI, 2.74 to 5.20). While used for the full array of medical conditions, they were used infrequently for chronic pain (used by 20% of those with chronic pain) and insomnia (used by 13% of those with insomnia), conditions for which consensus panels have concluded that mind-body therapies are effective. They were also used by less than 20% of those with heart disease, headaches, back or neck pain, and cancer, conditions for which there is strong research support. Mind-body therapies were generally used concomitantly with conventional care: 90% of those using a mind-body therapy in the last year had seen a physician and 80% of mind-body therapies used were discussed with a physician.

No randomized studies with evidence-based data are available to settle this issue. Only a few reports have been published; their shortcomings include small numbers of patients evaluated retrospectively, a broad spectrum of indications for ACT, different types of hemorrhage, and variable methods of reversing and restarting ACT. Despite this variability, most reports agree that 1) ACT has to be immediately reversed to decrease the risk of hemorrhage progression; 2) a period between 1 and 2 weeks appears sufficient to allow for management and monitoring of the hemorrhage off ACT; and 3) ACT can be safely restarted after the period off of treatment. A physician confronting a patient with intracranial hemorrhage and the need for ACT faces a situation of individually focused clinical decision making. The problem rests in balancing the risks of a worsening or recurring hemorrhage on one side, and the risk of thromboembolism on the other. From available information and personal experience, an unvalidated risk stratification can be proposed to categorize patients in low- and high-risk groups for hemorrhagic complications and embolic phenomena, assigning them to 5 or 15 days off ACT, respectively. Intermediate-risk patients can have ACT restarted in 5 to 15 days from the onset of the intracranial hemorrhage. Anticoagulation should be immediately reversed. Fresh frozen plasma is the standard treatment in most institutions. Prothrombin complex concentrate is an alternative, but issues of availability make its use impractical. The use of recombinant factor VIIa is an attractive new option.","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:22.247Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:22.247Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67274630a723a79f094e77","title":"Pharmacovigilance of Herbal Medicines","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00002018-200326120-00001","abstract":"There is an increasing awareness at several levels of the need to develop pharmacovigilance practices for herbal medicines. The current model of pharmacovigilance and its associated tools have been developed in relation to synthetic drugs, and applying these methods to monitoring the safety of herbal medicines presents unique challenges in addition to those described for conventional medicines. Several problems relate to the ways in which herbal medicines are named, perceived, sourced, and utilised. Other important challenges arise from the current regulatory framework for herbal medicines in the UK.In the UK at present, the Committee on Safety of Medicines/Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s (CSM/MHRA) ‘yellow card’ scheme for adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting is the main method of monitoring the safety of herbal medicines. Despite recent initiatives to stimulate reporting of suspected ADRs associated with herbal medicines, such as extending the scheme to unlicensed herbal products, and including community pharmacists as recognised reporters, numbers of herbal ADR reports received by the CSM/MHRA remain relatively low. Under-reporting, an inevitable and important limitation of spontaneous reporting schemes, is likely to be significant for herbal medicines, since users typically do not seek professional advice about their use of such products, or report if they experience adverse effects. The herbal sector in the UK has initiated various spontaneous reporting schemes, based on the yellow card scheme, but targeted mainly at herbal-medicine practitioners. It is important that these schemes have a link with the CSM/MHRA so that potential signals are not missed. Several other tools used in pharmacovigilance of conventional medicines, such as prescription-event monitoring, and the use of computerised health-record databases, currently are of no use for evaluating the safety of herbal and other non-prescription medicines.Proposed European Union legislation for traditional herbal medicinal products will require manufacturers of products registered under new national schemes to comply with regulatory provisions on pharmacovigilance. In the longer term, other improvements in safety monitoring of herbal medicines may include modifications to existing methodology, patient reporting and greater consideration of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in optimising the safety of herbal medicines.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:22.247Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:22.247Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67274c30a723a79f094e80","title":"Hematologic Complications of Alternative Remedies","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02982083","abstract":"The use of alternative therapies increased dramatically over the last decade with a wide variety of methods and interventions.

(2) Do physicians use the available resources to evaluate the possible drug interactions and/or side effects of the dietary supplements? and (3) Are physicians aware of the side effects, drug interactions and contraindications of ten commonly used herbs? A questionnaire was randomly distributed to medical students and faculty of the State University of New York, Health Science Center at Brooklyn. One hundred sixty five surveys were returned out of 193 handed out (85%). Analysis revealed that although many physicians asked their patients about their use of alternative remedies, most do not check the remedies in a reference text. Age and training were negatively correlated in a statistically significant manner with (1) the likelihood of a physician prescribing alternative medicines; (2) checking the side effects and drug interactions of over the counter and prescription medications in a reference text; (3) asking patients specifically about alternative medicines; and (4) checking the side effects and drug interactions of alternative remedies in a reference text. In a question matching ten herbs and side-effects, the highest score was six out of ten correct and the average number correct was 1.32 with a standard deviation of 1.39.

One potential mechanism of action in colorectal cancer is the inhibition of c-Src kinase activity, since this proto-oncogene is hyperexpressed in human large-bowel tumours. Our results show that despite the 9-fold higher level of c-Src kinase activity found in HT29 cells, there was only a 1.4-fold difference in cytotoxicity as compared with BE cells, the latter being the most sensitive. Moreover, even at concentrations of geldanamycin that resulted in cell kill of 80% or more after a 24-h period of exposure, there was no effect on␣␣␣ c-Src kinase activity in HT29 cells, although c-Src protein was depleted at supralethal levels of exposure. We also investigated the metabolism of the quinone moiety of geldanamycin by DT-diaphorase, an enzyme that activates certain quinone antibiotics such as mitomycin C and is hyperexpressed in colorectal cancer cells. Geldanamycin was shown to be a substrate for␣DT-diaphorase present in HT29 cells. However, the lack of a major differential in cytotoxicity between HT29 and BE cells indicates that this is unlikely to be pharmacologically significant, since the former contains high levels of enzyme activity, whereas BE cells have no significant activity due to a point mutation in the DT-diaphorase (NQO1) gene. Although reduction of geldanamycin was also catalysed by non-DT-diaphorase reductases in HT29 and BE cells, providing the potential for free radical induction, this is unlikely to be significant since studies previously reported by us elsewhere showed that cells exposed to geldanamycin exhibited no evidence of DNA damage. Thus, as far as the mode of action of geldanamycin in human colon-carcinoma cells is concerned, the present results rule out two major possibilities, namely, the involvement of c-Src tyrosine kinase inhibition and DT-diaphorase metabolism.","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:31.559Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:31.559Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67275730a723a79f094e90","title":"Administration of the vasopressin analog desmopressin for the management of bleeding in rectal cancer patients: results of a phase I/II trial","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10637-020-00914-5","abstract":"Purpose The vasopressin analog desmopressin (dDAVP) is known to increase plasma levels of hemostatic factors, and preclinical studies in colorectal cancer models have demonstrated that it hampers tumor vascularization and metastatic progression.

There is minimal literature evaluating direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients who have just received a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR) or mitral valve replacement (MVR). The purpose of this study was to investigate any differences in efficacy and safety for patients taking a DOAC, compared with warfarin, after a bioprosthetic AVR or MVR.A retrospective cohort study was performed to evaluate anticoagulation in patients who received bioprosthetic valve replacements at a large teaching hospital from 2014 to 2018. Patients included in this study received either warfarin or a DOAC following bioprosthetic AVR or MVR, and were maintained on the same agent throughout the 6-month follow-up period. The primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of thromboembolic complications and the primary safety outcome was the incidence of major bleeding within 6&nbsp;months following surgery. The rate of readmission was assessed as a secondary endpoint.A total of 197 patients were included; 70 patients received warfarin and 127 patients received a DOAC (apixaban, n = 86; rivaroxaban, n = 40; dabigatran, n = 1). Three patients experienced thromboembolic events, all of which occurred in the DOAC group (0% vs. 2.4%; p = 0.20). Major bleeding occurred in 11 patients—two in the warfarin group and nine in the DOAC group (2.9% vs. 7.1%; p = 0.22). Sixty-one patients were readmitted within the 6-month time frame, with 26 readmissions in the warfarin group and 35 readmissions in the DOAC group (37% vs. 27%; p = 0.16).This small, exploratory study found similar rates of thromboembolic complications and major bleeding events in patients who received a DOAC versus warfarin after a recent bioprosthetic AVR or MVR. This study was limited by its retrospective nature and its sample size. Larger, randomized controlled trials are needed to further determine the efficacy and safety of DOACs in this patient population.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:39.897Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:39.897Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67275730a723a79f094e94","title":"Predictors and Patterns of Transactional Sex with Casual Partners Among Adult Men Living in an Informal Urban Area, South Africa","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-020-02818-0","abstract":"Few studies have explored the relationship between transactional sex and HIV in adult men, with even fewer exploring the predictors of providing money or goods in exchange for sex. This study aimed to characterise the predictors and patterns of transactional sex in adult men in an urban informal area in South Africa. We used baseline, cross-sectional data from a study of 2406 men aged 18–40&nbsp;years from an urban informal area. Past year transactional sex was assessed through questions adapted from those used previously. Controlling behaviour was measured using an adapted Sexual Relationship Power Scale. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine associations between transactional sex and other potential explanatory variables. Nearly half (47%) of respondents who had ever had sex reported at least one type of transactional sex with a casual partner in the past year. A third of men provided support or money for a sex partner’s family, 30% provided cash and 28% provided somewhere to stay. Controlling for other factors, men with higher levels of controlling behaviour had nearly double the odds of engaging in transactional sex. Men reporting three or more sexual partners had significantly higher odds of engaging in transactional sex. Hazardous drinkers had 33% higher odds of engaging in transactional sex. Men’s provision of money or goods in exchange for sex with women is related to other high-risk behaviours, such as multiple sexual partners, hazardous drinking and controlling behaviour. To address transactional sex-related HIV risks, programming should address harmful masculinities, including relationship control.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:39.897Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:39.897Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67275730a723a79f094e95","title":"Recent Evidence of the Beneficial Effects Associated with Glucuronic Acid Contained in Kombucha Beverages","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13668-020-00312-6","abstract":"Glucuronic acid is contained naturally in kombucha beverages due to the associations between bacteria and yeasts during its fermentation.

Nutrition, weight management and physical activity are necessary health promotion strategies to improve overall quality of life and decrease the personal and societal consequences or poor health. Community pharmacists are in the best position to implement health promotion strategies due to their excellent accessibility and the lack of a requirement to make an appointment to interact with them. Enabling people to change their lifestyle and control their health through nutrition education and counseling is a great opportunity for community pharmacists to promote health. Nutrition counseling as a part of clinical nutrition therapy aims to provide dietary advice and to assist the selection of appropriate over-the-counter supplements. Objective To investigate the community pharmacist role in nutrition counseling and identify the barriers and strategies to improve nutrition counseling in Egypt. Setting Community pharmacies in Egypt. Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted with a knowledge, attitude, and practice survey. A specially developed and validated questionnaire was used to collect data via face-to-face structured interviews. Primary outcomes Pharmacists’ knowledge about, attitudes towards and practice of nutrition counseling. Results A total of 368 community pharmacists participated in this study, with a response rate of 73.6%. A total of 255 (69.3%) of the participants considered medical nutrition therapy a part of a pharmacist’s duties. Only 146 (39.7%) of the participants believed that dietary supplements positively impact public health. According to 321 (87.2%) of the participants, the lack of pharmacists’ expertise in nutrition counseling was the main barrier to nutrition counseling. Conclusions The majority of the participating community pharmacists had positive attitudes towards their role in nutritional assessment and medical nutrition therapy. There is a need to improve the nutritional knowledge of community pharmacists in Egypt. The current practice of community pharmacists in nutrition counseling is limited to adults. Obesity, diabetes and hypertension were the main medical conditions of the patients who received nutrition counseling from the community pharmacists. Inadequate knowledge in nutrition and the unavailability of educational materials were the main barriers to nutrition counseling.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:39.897Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:39.897Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67275730a723a79f094e97","title":"Social network support and harm reduction activities in a peer researcher-led pilot study, British Columbia, Canada","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12954-020-00401-3","abstract":"People who smoke drugs (PWSD) are at high risk of both infectious disease and overdose.

We evaluated the numbers of supportive network members and the relationships between received support and participants’ harm-reducing activities.Initial peer-researchers with past or current lived drug use experience were employed from communities in Abbotsford and Vancouver to interview ten friends from their social networks who use illegal drugs mainly through smoking. Contacts completed a questionnaire about people in their own harm reduction networks and their relationships with each other. We categorized social support into informational, emotional, and tangible aspects, and harm reduction into being trained in the use of, or carrying naloxone, assisting peers with overdoses, using brass screens to smoke, obtaining pipes from service organizations and being trained in CPR.Fifteen initial peer researchers interviewed 149 participants who provided information on up to 10 people who were friends or contacts and the relationships between them. People who smoked drugs in public were 1.46 (95% CI, 1.13-1.78) more likely to assist others with possible overdoses if they received tangible support; women who received tangible support were 1.24 (95% CI; 1.02-1.45) more likely to carry and be trained in the use of naloxone. There was no relationship between number of supportive network members and harm reduction behaviors.In this pilot study, PWSD who received tangible support were more likely to assist peers in possible overdoses and be trained in the use of and/or carry naloxone, than those who did not receive tangible support. Future work on the social relationships of PWSD may prove valuable in the search for credible and effective interventions.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:39.898Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:39.898Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67275730a723a79f094e98","title":"A Machine Learning Approach to Estimate the Glomerular Filtration Rate in Intensive Care Unit Patients Based on Plasma Iohexol Concentrations and Covariates","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40262-020-00927-6","abstract":"This work aims to evaluate whether a machine learning approach is appropriate to estimate the glomerular filtration rate in intensive care unit patients based on sparse iohexol pharmacokinetic data and a limited number of predictors.Eighty-six unstable patients received 3250&nbsp;mg of iohexol intravenously and had nine blood samples collected 5, 30, 60, 180, 360, 540, 720, 1080, and 1440&nbsp;min thereafter.

In this study, we used a novel approach—latent class analysis (LCA)—to assess heterogeneity.We developed a health preference survey that consisted of 12 discrete choice questions. The following attributes of convenience were included: intake frequency; need for regular coagulation monitoring; diet or drug interactions; relation between medication and food intake; and pill type. Background questions about gender, age, current therapy [i.e., direct-acting oral anti-coagulant (DOAC) or vitamin K antagonist (VKA)], self-reported medication adherence, and pill burden were included. Mixed logit analysis (MLA) and LCA were performed. The scale-adjusted LCA model with two scale classes and four preference classes emerged as the model with the best fit and interpretability.A total of 508 patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation from five European countries (Germany, Italy, Spain, France, and the UK) were surveyed in August 2017. The most important attributes were need for monitoring (37%) and intake frequency (27%). Patient preferences were significantly influenced by country, gender, and current anti-coagulant therapy. Four different preference classes of patients were identified in the LCA. First, most patients (57%) were in the “no need for regular coagulation monitoring” class. Current DOAC users and patients who were the least adherent to therapy were more likely to prefer no coagulation monitoring. Second, 20% of patients were in the “balanced” class of patients. Current VKA users with moderate adherence were more likely to be in this class. Patients who reported the lowest adherence were most likely in the “once daily, interactions likely” class (16%). Fourth, current VKA users and highly adherent patients were most likely to prefer therapies with a need for regular coagulation monitoring (7%).This study demonstrated significant preference heterogeneity among patients with atrial fibrillation and linked these preferences to differences in background characteristics.

Program participants included patients aged 18 years or older who had taken more than 4 prescribed medications and were diagnosed with at least one of the following chronic diseases: hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma or diabetes. Under the CMM program, a clinical pharmacist reviewed patients’ electronic health records and created action plans to resolve identified drug problems. As part of the evaluation of the clinical process, two independent physicians conducted peer review on the recommendations issued by the pharmacist in order to establish inter-rater reliability of drug therapy problems and potential consequent medical services. The drug therapy problems were identified and classified into four categories: indication, effectiveness, safety and/or compliance. The average cost of avoided medical services was obtained based on cost extrapolations from the literature, combined with hospital discharge data. Potential medical services avoided were linked to the average cost of those services to calculate the total cost savings of the program from the payers’ perspective.By reviewing electronic health records of 3280 patients, the pharmacist identified 301 drug therapy problems and resolved 49.8% of these problems with collaboration from the patient’s primary care physician or care team.

Despite being marketed later than other NOACs, its use is now spreading in current clinical practice, being indicated for both thromboprophylaxis in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In patients with multiple conditions, the contemporary administration of several drugs can cause relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs), which can affect drugs’ pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Usually, all the NOACs are considered to have significantly fewer DDIs than vitamin K antagonists; notwithstanding, this is actually not true, all of them are affected by DDIs with drugs that can influence the activity (induction or inhibition) of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 3A4, both responsible for the disposition and metabolism of NOACs to a different extent. In this review/expert opinion, we focused on an extensive report of edoxaban DDIs. All the relevant drugs categories have been examined to report on significant DDIs, discussing the impact on edoxaban pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and the evidence for dose adjustment. Our analysis found that, despite a restrained number of interactions, some strong inhibitors/inducers of P-gp and drug-metabolising enzymes can affect edoxaban concentration, just as it happens with other NOACs, implying the need for a dose adjustment. However, our analysis of edoxaban DDIs suggests that given the small propensity for interactions of this agent, its use represents an acceptable clinical decision. Still, DDIs can be significant in certain clinical situations and a careful evaluation is always needed when prescribing NOACs.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:58.255Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:58.255Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67276a30a723a79f094eb8","title":"Real-life use of lenvatinib in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer: experience from Argentina","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12020-020-02290-9","abstract":"To describe the experience with radioiodine-resistant differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC) patients treated with lenvatinib in two university hospitals from Argentina.Adult patients with a diagnosis of RR-DTC treated with lenvatinib from April 2017 to February 2020 were registered into a retrospective database.

Median PFS was 13.7 months (95% CI 3.2–24.2). All patients experienced at least one AE. Grade ≥3 AEs were observed in eight (36.4%) patients. Hypertension was the most frequent AE (63.6%) and the most common grade ≥3 AE (22.7%). Definitive withdrawal was necessary in two patients due to recurrent proteinuria (9%).Tumor responses and PFS in our study were in line with other real-life clinical data and they seem to be inferior to the reported in the SELECT trial, probably related to the higher number of patients with prior MKI therapy, comorbidities, and poor performance status. Although virtually all patients experienced AEs, most of them were manageable and rarely a definitive withdrawal was necessary.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:58.255Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:58.255Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67276a30a723a79f094eb9","title":"Comparative effectiveness and safety of direct oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in morbidly obese patients with acute venous thromboembolism: systematic review and a meta-analysis","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11239-020-02179-4","abstract":"Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) agents are becoming the anticoagulation strategy of choice.

There is no standardized method for assessing total serum mast cell tryptase (MCT) in anaphylaxis. The Working Conference in 2010 proposed a consensus equation (peak MCT should be > 1.2x baseline tryptase + 2&nbsp;ng/L) to diagnose acute mast cell activation (aMCA). Our objective was to narratively review the literature since the Working Conference in 2010, examining the use of the consensus equation and other equations comparing baseline and peak serum tryptase during anaphylaxis. Computerized bibliographic searches of PUBMED and EMBASE were supplemented with a manual search of reference lists. English-language studies were included. Eleven studies met our inclusion criteria with a total of 4551 participants. However, only four studies with 653 participants used the consensus equation. The other seven studies used other methods to compare peak and baseline serum tryptase concentrations. Measuring serum tryptase levels is valuable in the diagnosis of anaphylaxis but is unable to detect all anaphylactic reactions. Based on our current literature review, the consensus equation is underused in the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. There is also a need for exploration of other biomarkers which could be used in parallel to peak and baseline serum tryptase measurements for further diagnostic certainty. Serum tryptase is the most studied biomarker in anaphylaxis but is still far from being the ideal biomarker for this. There is a need to identify new potential useful biomarkers. Serum tryptase levels are valuable in the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, but are unable to detect all anaphylactic reactions. Additionally serial tryptase measurements are laborious in daily clinical practice.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:58.255Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:56:58.255Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67276a30a723a79f094ebb","title":"Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants Versus Warfarin in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and Peripheral Artery Disease: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10557-020-06962-6","abstract":"The efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) remain largely unknown.

Individual-level barriers to HIV care included lack of money and food, use of alternative care, negative side effects of ART, denial, and disclosure difficulties. At the community level, stigma, limited social support for conventional HIV treatment, and poor means of transport were reported.

Recognizing the gap between patient expectation and perception during pharmacist–patient communication can help to identify communication problems and suggest ways to improve communication. Objective To evaluate the gap between patient expectation and perception of sharing information and communications skills during pharmacist–patient communication. Setting Community pharmacies in South Korea. Method A questionnaire was developed to collect expectation and perception of sharing information and communication skills. Items for sharing information included drug effect, dosage/route of administration, adverse drug reactions, storage, drug–drug interactions, drug–food interactions, managing a missed dose or overdose, co-medication, and past drug allergies. Communication skills included friendliness, expertise, easy language, emphasis on main content, confirmation of understanding, enough time, calm environment, and private space. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 500 convenience sample using an online or written questionnaire in May 2018. Responses about patient expectation and perception were scored using 4-point Likert scales. Gap between patient expectation and perception was calculated as the differences among 4-point Likert scores. Factors associated with patient expectation and gap scores were evaluated using a multivariable regression method. Main outcome measure Patient expectation and perception of sharing information, as well as perception of communication skills during pharmacist–patient communication (questionnaire consisting 35 items). Results This study analyzed responses of 460 participants who answered all items on the questionnaire. Most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they want to share information with pharmacists. All items had significant gap between patient expectation and perception (p < 0.01). Gap scores were highest for adverse drug reaction, drug–drug interaction, and past drug allergies (all, median 2). Gap scores were negatively associated with age 50–59&nbsp;years, ≥ 60&nbsp;years, and presence of ≥ 1 chronic illness. Patient perception of communication skills, especially regarding private space, were poor. Conclusions The information shared with pharmacists was significantly less than that expected by participants, and most pharmacist communication skills were evaluated as poor. Understanding the expectation of each patient and communicating accordingly with appropriate communication skills are necessary to improve patient-centered communication in community pharmacies.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:01.820Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:01.820Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67276d30a723a79f094ec5","title":"A rare case of diarrhea and ascites","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00384-020-03523-z","abstract":"Eosinophilic enterocolitis is a rare condition included in the spectrum of the eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders.

Heart healthy is prostate healthy, and heart unhealthy is prostate unhealthy.The primary goal of reducing the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality also coincides with maximizing prostate cancer prevention. The obesity epidemic in children and adults along with recent diverse research has only strengthened the nexus between heart and prostate health. Greater dietary adherence toward a variety of healthy foods is associated with a graded improved probability of CVD and potentially aggressive cancer risk reduction. Preventing prostate cancer via dietary supplements should encourage a “first do no harm,” or less is more approach until future evidence can reverse the concerning trend that more supplementation has resulted in either no impact or an increased risk of prostate cancer. Supplements to reduce side effects of some cancer treatments appear to have more encouraging data. A discussion of quality (QC) before utilizing any pill also requires attention. Medications or interventions that potentially improve heart health including statins, aspirin, and metformin (S.A.M.), specific beta-blocker medications, and even preventive vaccines are in general generic, low-cost, “natural,” and should continue to garner research interest.

There are recent studies suggesting that oxidative stress could play a role in the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate thiol (SH)–disulfide (SS) hemostasis as a new marker of oxidative stress (OS) in infants with atopic dermatitis. Thirty-one infants with AD and 30 healthy infants were included in a prospective, cross-sectional study. PO-SCORAD Index of infants with atopic dermatitis was calculated at the time of sample collection. Total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), native thiol (–SH), total thiol (–SH + –S–S–), and disulfide (SS) were measured in the control and patient groups. SS/SH, SS/total SH, SH/total SH ratios were compared between the groups. Mean native thiol and total thiol concentrations of the patient group were lower than the control group (p = 0.012; 0.047). The mean disulfide concentration of the patient group was significantly higher than the control group (p = 0.025). SS/SH, SS/total SH, and SH/total SH ratios were significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group (p < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the duration of the breasting of the patients and thiol concentrations (p = 0.000). In our study, we found increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant defense mechanisms in infants with AD. Dynamic thiol–disulfide balance in the patient group was weakened and the balance shifted towards the oxidative side. These results may shed light on etiopathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and be useful in the development of new therapeutic methods.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:07.670Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:07.670Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67277330a723a79f094ecb","title":"Childhood Anaphylaxis: State of the Art","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40521-020-00241-3","abstract":"Anaphylaxis is a systemic immunologic reaction of immediate hypersensitivity that occurs as consequence of an interaction between antigen and immunoglobulin E (IgE) and may be potentially fatal.

This study describes the rationale and development of the MYMEDS tool, its performance and usefulness in identifying modifiable barriers to adherence in cardiology medical practice including user feedback of 204 consecutive post-MI patients who completed an evaluation based on MYMEDS.Modifiable non-adherence factors were initially identified based on literature review and stakeholder feedback. A draft MYMEDS questionnaire was piloted in 10 patients and adapted accordingly. The final version comprises six sections, covering current medicines, understanding and satisfaction with medicines, concerns about medicines, practical adherence barriers, fitting medicines into daily routine, and adherence to individual SPMs. The questionnaire was mailed to post-MI patients who then attended an outpatient medicines optimisation clinic.Mean age was 70.5 years and 67.6% were male. The tool was effective in revealing modifiable adherence barriers that could be addressed during the consultation. There were high rates of concern that SPMs could be harmful (33.2%) or overprescribed (43.2%), practical issues with swallowing medicines (8.2%), opening packaging (7.3%) or accessing repeat prescriptions (5.2%), forgetfulness (19.7%), and concerns about inconvenience (13.5%). Mean number of barriers per patient was 1.8 ± 1.5. The medications most commonly associated with non-adherence were statins (21.5%), angiotensin II receptor blockers (21.1%), and antiplatelet agents (18.5%). In total, 42.5% of patients acknowledged non-adherence behaviour. Patient feedback on MYMEDS was positive, with near-unanimous agreement that it was simple, clear and not too long, and that it enabled them to raise any concerns they had about their medicines. Patients reported that their individual medicines related needs were better addressed.MYMEDS is a practical tool that can successfully identify modifiable barriers to SPM adherence which can be addressed in a clinical setting.

Objective To evaluate the applicability and reliability of Grupo de Investigação em Cuidados Farmacêuticos (GIGUF) method for prescription analysis, identification and classification of drug-related problems in inpatients prescriptions. Setting Department of Medical Clinic of a tertiary and teaching Brazilian hospital. Method An observational and retrospective study of identification and classification of drug-related problems. GIGUF method was used to evaluate prescriptions of hematological patients hospitalized between August and October 2015. The problems were categorized using GICUF-method classification. Three pharmacists performed inter-rater agreement analysis of the method using Kappa. Differences in prevalence of DRP was calculated by age, sex, pharmacotherapy complexity, length of stay and number of drugs. Main outcome measure (a) frequency and characteristics and (b) inter-rater agreement in identification and classification of the drug-related problems. Results A total of 211 problems were identified and ‘inadequate dosing' was the most common&nbsp;problem. There was an association between the occurence of a drug-reklated problem and complexity of pharmacotherapy (p = 0.001) and number of drugs used (p = 0.010). The overall inter-rater agreement was moderate (k = 0.44 IC 95% 0.34–0.55) and the problem ‘not suitable drug' (k = 0.55 IC 95% 0.44–0.66) had greater inter-rater agreement. Conclusion The method “Evaluation Drug Use Process” was useful for prescription analysis since it made the identification and classification of DRPs possible.

The secondary outcome and physiological response of microbiome abundance modulation included the non- significant fluctuation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Also, some studies have suggested a reno-protective property of beetroot juice that is associated with the reduction of mortality rate and favorable changes in kidney’s functional parameters among patients with renal disorders.

Older adults are at a higher risk of adverse events and reduced therapeutic response. This phenomenon is partially explained by drug interactions and treatment adherence. Most randomized clinical trials have found no significant differences between morning and evening levothyroxine (LT4) administration in young adults, but there is little evidence regarding alternative LT4 regimens in older populations. Thus, the MONIALE trial aims to test an alternative schedule for LT4 administration in older adults.This randomized crossover clinical trial will include participants aged 60 years or older with primary hypothyroidism. The trial groups will consist of morning LT4 intake (60 min before breakfast) or evening LT4 intake (60 min after supper). The primary outcome will be variation in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels after 24 weeks of the LT4 protocol. The secondary outcomes will be the prevalence of drugs that potentially interact with LT4 and hypothyroidism control according to interaction status. The sample size was calculated to detect a minimum mean difference of 1 mUI/L in serum TSH level between the groups with 80% power and a 5% probability of type I error, resulting in 91 patients per group.

Patients were evaluated by general demographics, pain intensity scores (VAS), range of motion (ROM), WOMAC, knee scores, and functional scores as a primary objective. A duration for gait aid independent and patient’s satisfaction score as secondary objective. The study was 6&nbsp;weeks after surgery.TKR-H and TKR had significant differences in the mean of WOMAC score (88.29 ± 10.66 vs. 68.00 ± 12.47, respectively, P < &nbsp;0.001), pain score (VAS) (6.25 ± 10.13 vs. 35.67 ± 22.05, respectively, P < &nbsp;0.001), knee score (81.67 ± 10.08 vs. 68.38 ± 6.45, respectively, P < &nbsp;0.001), functional score (77.83 ± 4.22 vs. 73.70 ± 7.48, respectively, P = 0.037), and range of motion (107.71 ± 8.47 vs. 98.17 ± 9.57, respectively, P = 0.001). The patient’s satisfaction score in TKR-H group (4.71 ± 0.46) was significantly higher than the TKR group (4.13 ± 0.45) (P < &nbsp;0.001) and time to gait aid independent (2.75 ± 0.99 vs. 3.71 ± 1.23, respectively, P = 0.005).Our TKR-H showed better clinical outcomes and satisfaction than non-home visit. The rationale in TKR-H improves satisfaction after total knee replacement.TCTR20190514001.","year":"2019","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:24.104Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:24.104Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67278430a723a79f094ef1","title":"Comparative evaluation of drug information leaflets for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in Palestine: local versus imported products","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12913-019-4754-1","abstract":"Drug information leaflets (DILs) are written for patients and health care providers to show how to use the medications safely and effectively, in order to reach the required therapeutics outcomes.

Thirty-one statements were obtained from literature and used; evaluation was performed on basis of both any presence or absence of these statements in the leaflets. 23 of the 31 statements that were available in both local and imported DILs were also evaluated in terms of total word-counts: the median (interquartile range) word-count for each statement was determined separately for the two groups and then compared. For the remaining 8 statements, this was not performed,either because they were not present in any leaflet, or because counting the number of words would not be meaningful.A total of 35 DILs for nine different active ingredients of NSAIDs were analyzed. In 97% of leaflets, “Instructions to convert medication into liquid forms” were missing and 94% did not provide any information about “Pharmacokinetics”. 83% of DILs provided no information about “Mechanism of action” and 74% did not mention any reliable references. 66% of the analyzed inserts did not include any instruction about the possibility of a tablet splitting.

In India, in the absence of any such policy until recently, there are very few organizations involved in RD R&D.We wished to understand (i) the OMP Organizations’ (OMPOs’) areas of work and the nature of their work, (ii) their goals, (iii) the challenges they faced and how they were overcoming them, (iv) their achievements, and (v) their recommendations to the government to help their R&D, their success as commercial entities (where applicable), and patients’ access to their products or services.Ten of the 14 OMPOs are companies, whereas four are not-for-profit organizations. Almost all of the OMPOs are heavily into R&D. Six have already made their products or services available to patients. Four plan to out-license their products after the pre-clinical phase or phase 1 trials, eight plan to cater to patients directly and two of the OMPOs have been established only recently and thus do not yet have any product or service to offer patients. Nine OMPOs import about 90% of the components in the production process, which comprises either capital or recurrent expenditure. For most, locally manufactured alternatives are not available or are of inadequate quality. Most of the OMPOs have had productive collaborations with local or foreign academics or hospitals for R&D, animal efficacy studies, clinical trials or providing services to patients. The main challenges for the OMPOs are the lack of adequate funding, supportive government policies, and a conducive ecosystem.These OMPOs are pioneers in their respective fields in India, and despite the challenges, have achieved new levels of innovation. With suitable government policies, they could scale up and provide relevant products and services to the large number of RD patients in the country whose medical needs are largely unmet.","year":"2019","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:24.104Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:24.104Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67278430a723a79f094ef4","title":"Mental Health Diagnoses of Youth Commercial Sex Exploitation Victims: an Analysis within an Adjudicated Delinquent Sample","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10896-019-00065-z","abstract":"Existing criminology and victimization research suggests that youth victims of commercial sex often have mental health issues stemming from their sex victimization and/or emerging out of their long histories of family abuse, neglect and family conflict.

Older, first-generation AHs (e.g. diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) have significant and common side effects including sedation, impairment with decreased cognitive function, poor sleep quality, dry mouth, dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension. These drugs have also been found to result in death from accidents, intentional or unintentional overdoses, and sudden cardiac death. The unfavourable risk–benefit profile of first-generation AHs led to the development of newer, less-sedating second- and third-generation AHs, which first became available in Canada in the 1980s. High-quality trials have proven that newer generation AHs are superior in safety compared to older first-generation AHs. On average, they have improved potency and efficacy. Second- and third-generation AHs are the recommended first-line treatment for mild allergic rhinitis and acute and chronic urticaria. Despite this evidence, older first-generation AHs continue to be over-utilized because of their over-the-counter (OTC) status and long history of use. The Canadian Society of Allergy Clinical Immunology (CSACI) recommends that newer generation AHs should be preferred over first-generation AHs for the treatment of allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and urticaria. To promote this recommendation, education of health professionals and the public is necessary. Further, given the dangers of older first-generation AHs, we believe they should be used only as a last resort with eventual consideration given to having them only available behind the counter in pharmacies.","year":"2019","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:24.105Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:24.105Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67278830a723a79f094ef8","title":"Engagement in HIV Care Among New York City Transgender Women of Color: Findings from the Peer-Led, TWEET Intervention, a SPNS Trans Women of Color Initiative","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-019-02667-6","abstract":"Transgender women (TW) have higher HIV prevalence rates than cisgender (i.e., non-transgender) women.

Statistical comparisons of the word count for all products were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test with mean ranks. Then the mean ranks for differences in word counts were adjusted to calculate the fold-difference statistic by dividing the higher mean rank by the lower mean rank.In general, the PPIs of imported agents scored better than local PPIs, but none of the inserts fulfilled the whole criteria. Thirteen out of thirty-one criteria were available in all products. None of these agents had provided any information about duration of use, instructions to convert tablets into liquids forms, pharmacokinetics, or shelf life. Moreover, mechanism of action and maximum dose were deficient in all local PPIs (0.0%), while they were included in 37.5 and 62.5% of imported PPIs, respectively. Furthermore, 90.0% of local PPIs lacked information about drug dose, 80.0% didn’t mention any instructions regarding effects on ability to drive or possibility of tablet splitting, and 60.0% didn’t involve orders about possibility of tablet crushing. Local PPIs provided inadequate and less detailed instructions regarding many aspects, since the estimated mean rank of local and imported PPIs demonstrated a range of difference from 1.04-fold for missing dose to 2.64-fold for warning and precautions.Significant differences were being identified, with excellence being assigned to imported PPIs. So, it is worth suggesting some necessary modifications in PPI topography and sequence structure of local diabetic agents. Experts in Palestinian Ministry of Health should implement regulatory guidelines to improve the quality and quantity of information provided by local PPIs.

Objective To investigate the nature and frequency of DRPs along with the role of pharmacists in a stroke unit. Setting The study was conducted at the stroke unit of Siriraj hospital, a university affiliated tertiary care hospital in Thailand. Method A retrospective descriptive study of DRPs and pharmacists’ interventions for stroke patients was performed during July 2015 to December 2016. Data were collected from patient’s medical records and pharmacist’s intervention record forms. DRPs were categorized using the Hepler–Strand classification. The stroke pharmacist team, consisting of a board-certified pharmacotherapy specialist, neurology pharmacy residents and stroke unit pharmacists, participated in the multidisciplinary ward round in the stroke unit 5&nbsp;days a week. All patients were visited by a member of the stroke pharmacist team within the first two days of their admission to conduct a thorough review of drug therapy for every patient and provided appropriate recommendation to the multidisciplinary team either verbally during the ward round or with written information in the patients’ medical charts, as appropriate. Main Outcome Measure (a) incidence and characteristics of DRPs (b) types and the acceptance of pharmacists’ interventions. Results A total of 859 patients were admitted, of those, 768 patients had ≥ 1 DRPs and a total of 796 DRPs were identified. Clinical pharmacists provided 659 interventions to the multidisciplinary team. The most common DRPs identified were “untreated indications” (22.6%) and “non-compliance” (21.0%). Of all DRPs, 74.6% were stroke related issues. The most implicated drugs were antihypertensive drugs, followed by antithrombotic therapies. The multidisciplinary team accepted 84.7% of pharmacists’ interventions. Conclusion DRP in a stroke unit is common. Clinical pharmacists in a stroke unit can effectively reduce and prevent DRPs with the focus on performing medication reconciliation, providing recommendation on dosage adjustment and proper drug selection for stroke patients.","year":"2019","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:28.045Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:28.045Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67278830a723a79f094f01","title":"Triggering agents and microbiome as environmental factors on Behçet’s syndrome","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11739-018-2000-1","abstract":"Environmental and other triggering factors are suggested to cause the onset and the clinical relapses of Behçet’s syndrome (BS), a multi-systemic inflammatory disorder.

However, there are differences in the progression of pharmacovigilance systems by regulatory agencies in these countries because only some are able to meet the requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance activities. Only 45% of Arab countries are official members of the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring. Countries such as Morocco, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan are considered to be advanced pharmacovigilance countries, whereas other countries such as Libya, Yemen, and Palestine remain in the very early stages of implementing and developing pharmacovigilance systems. Countries such as Somalia, Djibouti, Mauritania, and Comoros Island have no pharmacovigilance system or culture. Asian Arab countries have some advantages over those in Africa because 50% of them are a part of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), meaning that most of them can utilize similar approaches for the application of the majority of activities related to the healthcare system, including pharmacovigilance. Thus, participating in the GCC enables increased connections among these countries. However, one of the strengths in Africa is that Morocco is partnering with the WHO through the WHO Collaborating Center to enhance and strengthen pharmacovigilance across the Eastern Mediterranean Region and the Francophone and Arab countries. This partnership could have a role in enhancing the pharmacovigilance culture among African Arab countries.

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), defined as “a pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image and affects, and marked impulsivity”, is not only common (up to 20% of psychiatric inpatients), but also strongly associated with suicide attempts and death by suicide. Therefore, BPD constitutes a major public health concern. As a consequence of an underlying condition of ontological addiction, self-harming behaviors can be conceptualized as addictions, suicidal acts reflecting an experiential avoidance strategy against unbearable psychological pain. The present paper aims at: (1) understanding BPD daily life experiences from the perspective of OAT; (2) offering psychotherapeutic perspectives for this mental disorder. The diagnostic category of BDP may be understood as a simple label reflecting several extreme types of manifestations resulting from the Self-grasping ignorance that underpins ontological addiction. Therefore, development of psychotherapeutic interventions targeting ontological addiction appears to be a promising future direction.","year":"2019","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:33.995Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:33.995Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67278d30a723a79f094f06","title":"Multiple Antihyperglycemic Drug Use is Associated with Undernutrition Among Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13300-019-0602-x","abstract":"Undernutrition is prevalent in older age.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors are an effective treatment in preclinical models and patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-translocated cancers. Four anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors (crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib) have recently been approved. Post-marketing studies provided additional pharmacokinetic information on their pharmacokinetic parameters. The pharmacokinetic properties of approved anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors have been reviewed herein. Findings from additional studies on the effects of drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and drug–drug interactions have been incorporated. Crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib reach their maximum plasma concentrations after approximately 6&nbsp;h and brigatinib after 1–4&nbsp;h. These drugs are primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A with other cytochrome P450 enzymes. They are mainly excreted in the feces, with only a minor fraction being eliminated in urine. Crizotinib, ceritinib, and brigatinib are substrates for the adenosine triphosphate binding-cassette transporter B1, whereas alectinib is not. The different substrate specificities of the transporters play a key role in superior blood–brain barrier penetration by alectinib than by crizotinib and ceritinib. Although the absorption, distribution, and excretion of anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors are regulated by drug transporters, their transporter-mediated pharmacokinetics have not yet been elucidated in detail in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Further research to analyze the contribution of drug transporters to the pharmacokinetics of anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer will be helpful for understanding the mechanisms of the inter-individual differences in the pharmacokinetics of anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors.","year":"2018","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:37.511Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:37.511Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67279130a723a79f094f0e","title":"Economic efficiency versus accessibility: Planning of the hospital landscape in rural regions using a linear model on the example of paediatric and obstetric wards in the northeast of Germany","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12913-019-4016-2","abstract":"Costs for the provision of regional hospital care depend, among other things, on the population density and the maximum reasonable distance to the nearest hospital.

Thus, MMPs can be used as feasible measures of the efficiency of pharmacy teams. Objective To quantify the impact of a technician-enhanced clinical pharmacy model on medication reconciliation and timeliness of pharmacist tasks. Setting 480-bed tertiary teaching hospital in New South Wales. Method The effect of a technician working alongside the geriatric pharmacist in a single hospital was evaluated. Outcomes were measured throughout two 4-week periods pre- and post-implementation for patients under the supervision of a geriatrician who were discharged during usual business hours. Data were collected by the supervising pharmacist. Main outcome measure Primary outcomes were the number of MMPs completed daily on average and during admission, as well as the timeliness of updating discharge summaries, medication histories and MMPs. Results The mean number of daily MMPs significantly increased from 2.25 to 4.90 with the technician (p < 0.001, 95% CI 1.66 to 3.64). The median time to update discharge summary significantly decreased from 6:48 to 2:33&nbsp;h (p = 0.01). Conclusion This study suggested that technician-enhanced teams could improve the efficiency of clinical pharmacy services in an Australian hospital.","year":"2019","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:37.511Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:57:37.511Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67279130a723a79f094f14","title":"Association between Recent Criminal Justice Involvement and Transactional Sex among African American Men Who Have Sex with Men in Baltimore","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11524-019-00350-8","abstract":"Non-Hispanic Black/African American men who have sex with men (AAMSM) have been disproportionately affected by criminal justice (CJ) involvement and HIV.

The goal of this study was to explore the association between recent CJ involvement, i.e., having been arrested and/or in prison/jail in the past 6&nbsp;months, and transactional sex in a sample of AAMSM in Baltimore. We analyzed the baseline data of 396 AAMSM from a pilot behavioral HIV intervention conducted in Baltimore, MD, between October 2012 and November 2015. A multivariate logistic regression model was conducted to explore the association between recent CJ involvement and transactional sex. A total of 65 (16%) participants reported recent CJ involvement, and 116 (29%) reported transactional sex in the past 90&nbsp;days. After adjusting for age, education, employment, sexual identity, HIV status, and drug use, recent CJ involvement was significantly associated with transactional sex (AOR 3.31; 95% CI 1.72; 5.70).

The aim of this study is twofold: 1) describing the development of CMA and 2) evaluating the preliminary results, more specifically the number of clinical rule alerts, number of actions on the alerts and acceptance rate by physicians.CMA focuses on patients at risk for potentially inappropriate medication and involves the daily checking by a pharmacist of high-risk prescriptions generated by advanced clinical rules integrating patient specific characteristics with details on medication. Pharmacists’ actions are performed by adding an electronic note in the patients’ medical record or by contacting the physician by phone. A retrospective observational study was performed to evaluate the primary outcomes during an 18-month study period.39,481 clinical rule alerts were checked by pharmacists for which 2568 (7%) electronic notes were sent and 637 (1.6%) phone calls were performed. 37,782 (96%) alerts were checked within four pharmacotherapeutic categories: drug use in renal insufficiency (25%), QTc interval prolonging drugs (11%), drugs with a restricted indication or dosing (14%) and overruled very severe drug-drug interactions (50%). The emergency department was a frequently involved ward and anticoagulants are the drug class for which actions are most frequently carried out. From the 458 actions performed for the four abovementioned categories, 69% were accepted by physicians.These results demonstrate the added value of CMA to support medication surveillance in synergy with already integrated basic clinical decision support and bedside clinical pharmacy.

This work describes the evolution of the implementations of a program of pharmaceutical care centered in drug related problems (DRP) in a group of geriatric institutions of different levels of complexity.Setting: Long-term and subacute care hospitals (HSS) and Health care teams attending nursing homes (EARs).Participants: Patients attended in HSS and EARs during different periods between 2010 and 2016.Interventions: The program was developed in different stages, in which pharmacists made interventions of increasing complexity.Between 2010 and 2013, the approach was only to improve the prescription of non-appropriate drugs for the elderly, which was reduced from 19 to 14.5%. Subsequent steps included detection of drug-related problems (DRP), systematization of treatment revisions, recording of pharmacist interventions, improvements in the classification of interventions and the creation of a web-based database for recording in a more efficient way.During these years, there was an increase in the number of patients included in pharmaceutical care activities and thus the number of pharmacist interventions (3872 in 2014 vs 5903 in 2016). In 2016, mean age in 2016: 83.2 years old. Mean number of medicines/patient: 8.4 ± 3.3, and mean interventions/patient: 1.62.

In the Southwestern United States, reduviid bugs bites commonly cause insect allergy. In South China, four cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported after this bite exposure. To further classify the species of these bugs and confirm the sensitization of the triatomine saliva, we caught triatomine bugs from the region where the bites occurred and performed phylogenetic and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis.Triatomine bugs were collected in Donghai Island of Zhanjiang City in South China. The genomic DNA was extracted from three legs of the bugs. The fragments of mitochondrial 16S rRNA, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and nuclear ribosomal 18S and 28S rRNA genes were obtained by PCR and sequenced. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the sequence of 16S rRNA gene using a maximum likelihood method with MEGA 7.0 software. Trypanosomal specific fragments and vertebrate COI genes were amplified from the fecal DNA to detect the infection of trypanosomes and analyze the blood feeding patterns, respectively. Paraffin-embedded sections were then prepared from adult triatomines and sent for IHC staining.We collected two adult triatomine bugs in Donghai Island. Morphological and molecular analyses indicated that the triatomines were Triatoma rubrofasciata. No fragments of T. cruzi or other trypanosomes were detected from the fecal DNA. Mitochondrial gene segments of Homo sapiens and Mus musculus were successfully amplified. The allergens which induced specific IgE antibodies in human serum were localized in the triatomine saliva by IHC assay.The two triatomine bugs from Donghai Island were T. rubrofasciata.

Comparative analysis of the two surveys in this region showed similar results and produced a large amount of ethnopharmaceutical information.Lithuania belongs to the countries known for urban ethnobotany where old traditions overlap with modern healing methods. Also, because modern medical assistance is quite expensive, self-medication with home-made medicines is still popular in Lithuania. It is important to collect and systematize this information as soon as possible, to save it as a traditional Lithuanian heritage and also use it for scientific investigations.","year":"2018","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:01.450Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:01.450Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6727a930a723a79f094f39","title":"Contraceptive utilization among new exotic dancers: a cross-sectional study","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12954-018-0261-7","abstract":"Female exotic dancers are a population at high risk of unintended pregnancy.

All subjects completed all trial arms and were analyzed as planned.CBD was generally well tolerated. Diarrhea, nausea, headache, and somnolence were the most common adverse events (AEs) across all trial arms, with an increased incidence of some gastrointestinal and nervous system disorder AEs (most notably diarrhea and headache) apparent in subjects taking CBD compared with placebo. All AEs were of mild or moderate severity; none were severe or serious. There were no deaths or discontinuations in the trial. After single oral doses, CBD appeared rapidly in plasma; time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) was approximately 4–5&nbsp;h. The major circulating metabolite was 7-carboxy-CBD, then parent CBD, 7-hydroxy-CBD (active metabolite), and 6-hydroxy-CBD (a relatively minor metabolite). Plasma exposure to CBD [maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time t (AUCt)] increased in a less than dose-proportional manner (Cmax slope 0.73; AUCt slope 0.64). Oral clearance of CBD was high (1111–1909&nbsp;L/h) and apparent volume of distribution was large (20,963–42,849&nbsp;L).

The demographics of patients receiving a lung transplant have evolved with older, more critically ill patients and those with previously contraindicated indications, now becoming recipients. Despite the lack of new classes of maintenance immunosuppression drugs becoming available, advances have been made in the prescribing of traditional immunosuppressive therapies. Developments in immunosuppressive regimens have seen changes in the route of administration, approaches to monitoring and combinations used. Long-term complications of immunosuppression, such as nephrotoxicity and malignancy can limit the success of lung transplantation, and strategies have evolved in recent years to minimise their long-term impact. Although survival outcomes have been steadily improving, chronic lung allograft dysfunction remains a barrier to long-term success. However, treatments for antibody-mediated rejection are emerging as a potential new therapeutic target to decrease the incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction.

Subsequently, all features are annotated using the Human Metabolome Database, and statistical testing is performed to identify significantly perturbed metabolite concentrations in a patient sample compared with controls. We propose three main modalities to analyze complex, untargeted metabolomics data. First, a targeted evaluation can be done based on identified genetic variants of uncertain significance in metabolic pathways. Second, we developed a panel of IEM-related metabolites to filter untargeted metabolomics data. Based on this IEM-panel approach, we provided the correct diagnosis for 42 of 46 IEMs. As a last modality, metabolomics data can be analyzed in an untargeted setting, which we term “open the metabolome” analysis. This approach identifies potential novel biomarkers in known IEMs and leads to identification of biomarkers for as yet unknown IEMs. We are convinced that NGMS is the way forward in laboratory diagnostics of IEMs.","year":"2018","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:11.731Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:11.731Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6727b330a723a79f094f4b","title":"Global landscape assessment of screening technologies for medicine quality assurance: stakeholder perceptions and practices from ten countries","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12992-018-0360-y","abstract":"The spread of substandard and falsified (SF) medical products constitutes a growing global public health concern. Some countries use portable, handheld screening technologies (STs) in the field to accelerate detection of SF medicines and reduce the number of medicine samples that undergo costly and time-consuming confirmatory analysis.A multi-country, multi-stakeholder landscape assessment utilizing qualitative methodology was used to examine practices and perceptions related to the use of STs. Qualitative interview guides were designed using the results of a literature review and comprised of open-ended questions with the study participants, who were from national medicine regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacies, and distributors. Ten geographically and economically diverse countries were selected: Argentina, China, Egypt, India, Jordan, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, the United States, and Zimbabwe. Of the completed 53 interviews, 32 were in-person, 16 were phone interviews, and 5 were via written questionnaires.Data analysis shows a wide variation in understanding and usage of STs in different sectors. Virtually all of the study participants indicated a lack of objective, accessible information on STs to advise them on what technologies would be beneficial for their needs. Study participants also described their ideal capabilities of the next generation of STs, including shareable spectral libraries, lower acquisition costs, lesser training requirements, and in-country maintenance and technical support.The results and recommendations presented in this article can be used to help regulators communicate and justify their needs to acquire and invest in new STs. There is a need for additional standardized, trustworthy and scientifically sound evaluations of STs, and to support regulators to effectively deploy the most promising technologies. ST manufacturers can take into account some of the limitations of the technologies the interviewees identified in this article, such as a dearth of technologies, which provide quantitative information about the active ingredient, and take steps to address them to better serve their customers. These results and recommendations, can catalyze research and actionable interventions into the development, review, application, and use of STs.","year":"2018","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:11.731Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:11.731Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6727b330a723a79f094f4c","title":"Current State of Left Atrial Appendage Closure","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11886-018-0981-z","abstract":"Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained arrhythmia, is a major cause of stroke and systemic embolism, and is increasing in prevalence.

Recent prospective observational studies, including those evaluating outcomes after commercial approval in the USA, show significantly improved procedure safety compared with earlier experiences.LAAC appears to be an attractive alternative strategy for stroke prevention in AF patients, particularly in those who can take short-term oral anticoagulation (OAC), but are not optimal candidates for long-term OAC. Recent data suggests the procedure can be safely performed in patients with contraindications to OAC. Further, robust studies are needed to evaluate safety and efficacy in OAC-contraindicated patients, to compare outcomes with non-vitamin K antagonist OACs, and to explore the relative safety and efficacy of different LAAC devices.","year":"2018","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:11.731Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:11.731Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6727b330a723a79f094f4d","title":"SLIT’s Prevention of the Allergic March","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11882-018-0785-7","abstract":"The progression of atopic disorders from atopic dermatitis in infants to allergic rhinitis and asthma in children, adolescents, and adults defines the allergy march.

In China, the ‘Clinical Comprehensive Evaluation System for Pediatric Drugs’ (CCES-P) project, which aims to compare drugs based on clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness to help decision makers, was recently proposed; therefore, a systematic and objective method is required to guide the process.An evidence-based multi-criteria decision analysis model that involved an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was developed, consisting of nine steps: (1) select the drugs to be reviewed; (2) establish the evaluation criterion system; (3) determine the criterion weight based on the AHP; (4) construct the evidence body for each drug under evaluation; (5) select comparative measures and calculate the original utility score; (6) place a common utility scale and calculate the standardized utility score; (7) calculate the comprehensive utility score; (8) rank the drugs; and (9) perform a sensitivity analysis. The model was applied to the evaluation of three different inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) used for asthma management in children (a total of 16 drugs with different dosage forms and strengths or different manufacturers).By applying the drug analysis model, the 16 ICSs under review were successfully scored and evaluated. Budesonide suspension for inhalation (drug ID number: 7) ranked the highest, with comprehensive utility score of 80.23, followed by fluticasone propionate inhaled aerosol (drug ID number: 16), with a score of 79.59, and budesonide inhalation powder (drug ID number: 6), with a score of 78.98. In the sensitivity analysis, the ranking of the top five and lowest five drugs remains unchanged, suggesting this model is generally robust.An evidence-based drug evaluation model based on AHP was successfully developed.

On-demand PDE5Is have an overall efficacy of 60–70% for ED; 30–35% of patients fail to respond to a PDE5I, and 30–50% of non-responders can be salvaged with detailed counseling on proper use and physician follow-up to ensure that the patient has been prescribed an appropriate and full PDE5I clinical trial. True non-responders may be offered intracavernosal injections of erectogenic drugs, intraurethral alprostadil, or surgical insertion of a penile prosthesis. Such options are not discreet and are associated with more adverse effects than PDE5Is. Thus patients may request additional non-invasive medical management options. This review describes published literature on patients who failed to respond to an on-demand PDE5I regimen and were treated with a non-invasive PDEI-based regimen, including switching from one PDE5I to another; increasing the dose of PDE5I above the labeled dosage range; using two PDE5Is concurrently; using a daily PDE5I regimen; or combining a PDE5I with a testosterone supplement, α-adrenergic antagonist, intraurethral or intracavernosal alprostadil, vacuum erection device, or low-intensity shock wave therapy. The limitations of published clinical trials do not allow for sufficient evidence to recommend one option over another. Therefore, in PDE5I-refractory patients, the choice of a specific next step should be individualized based on the preference of the patient and his sexual partner, the advantages and disadvantages of the various options, the concurrent medical illnesses and medications of the patient, and the patient’s response to treatment.","year":"2018","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:17.904Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:17.904Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6727b930a723a79f094f55","title":"Readability of written medicine information materials in Arabic language: expert and consumer evaluation","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12913-018-2944-x","abstract":"Written Medicine Information (WMI) is one of the sources that patients use to obtain information concerning medicine.

Potential food-drug interactions involving flaxseed may be relevant for veterinary therapy, and for the quality and safety of milk and dairy products. Our aim was to investigate a potential food-drug interaction involving flaxseed, to explore whether the inclusion of flaxseed in sheep diet affects concentration of the antimicrobial danofloxacin in milk.Increased concentrations of enterodiol and enterolactone were observed in sheep plasma and milk after 2&nbsp;weeks of flaxseed supplementation (P < 0.05). However, enterolactone and enterodiol conjugates were not detected in milk.

Although cancer is a life-threatening condition, oncology medication adherence—the extent to which a patient follows the drug regimen that is intended by the prescriber—can be suboptimal in the long term, as in any other chronic disease. Poor adherence can impact negatively on clinical outcomes, notably because most of these drugs are given as a standard non-individualized dosage despite marked inter-individual variabilities that can lead to toxic or inefficacious drug concentrations. This has been especially studied with the prototypal drug imatinib. In the context of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), increasingly advocated for oral anticancer treatment optimization, unreported suboptimal adherence affecting drug intake history may lead to significant bias in the concentration interpretation and inappropriate dosage adjustments. In the same way, suboptimal adherence may also bias the results of pharmacokinetic modeling studies, which will affect in turn Bayesian TDM interpretation that relies on such population models. Detailed knowledge of the influence of adherence on plasma concentrations in pharmacokinetic studies or in routine TDM programs is however presently missing in the oncology field. Studies on this topic are therefore eagerly awaited to better pilot the treatment of cancer with the new targeted agents and to find their optimal dosage regimen.

Pharmacists performed a telephone follow-up intervention to discharged patients to provide medicines management support. Patients who received pharmacist telephone follow-up calls within 14 days of discharge formed the intervention group. A subset of medical patient population discharged in the month of May 2013 formed the comparison group. During a series of two-telephone follow-up, pharmacists identified post-discharge pharmaceutical problems and provided patient-tailored interventions accordingly. The impact of pharmacist interventions was assessed using a risk assessment matrix tool by two senior pharmacists. Overall 30-day readmission rates in the intervention group were measured and compared with the comparison group using a chi-square test.Between 5th and 25th June 2013, a total of 62 medical patients participated in the study. Pharmacists provided 192 interventions as a result of pharmacist telephone follow-up intervention. The most prevalent type of interventions was the provision of drug information (n=40), followed by screening patient adherence (n=30) and advising on adverse drug reactions (n=27). The impact of interventions was assessed, and 49.3% of the identified risks intervened by pharmacists were associated with moderate risk. The 30-day readmission rates in the intervention group were 11.3% compared to 9.0% in the control group (p = 0.376); this was not statistically significant.A pharmacist TFU intervention did not show a benefit in 30-day hospital readmissions.

Therefore, we aimed by using six sigma approach to propose a way that reduces these errors to become less than 1 out of 100 administrated medication doses by improving healthcare professional education and clearer handwritten prescriptions.The study was held in a General Government Hospital. First, we systematically studied the current medication use process. Second, we used six sigma approach by utilizing the five-step DMAIC process (Define, Measure, Analyze, Implement, Control) to find out the real reasons behind such errors. This was to figure out a useful solution to avoid medication error incidences in daily healthcare professional practice. Data sheet was used in Data tool and Pareto diagrams were used in Analyzing tool.In our investigation, we reached out the real cause behind administrated medication errors. As Pareto diagrams used in our study showed that the fault percentage in administrated phase was 24.8%, while the percentage of errors related to prescribing phase was 42.8%, 1.7 folds. This means that the mistakes in prescribing phase, especially because of the poor handwritten prescriptions whose percentage in this phase was 17.6%, are responsible for the consequent) mistakes in this treatment process later on. Therefore, we proposed in this study an effective low cost strategy based on the behavior of healthcare workers as Guideline Recommendations to be followed by the physicians. This method can be a prior caution to decrease errors in prescribing phase which may lead to decrease the administrated medication error incidences to less than 1%.This improvement way of behavior can be efficient to improve hand written prescriptions and decrease the consequent errors related to administrated medication doses to less than the global standard; as a result, it enhances patient safety. However, we hope other studies will be made later in hospitals to practically evaluate how much effective our proposed systematic strategy really is in comparison with other suggested remedies in this field.","year":"2017","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:35.446Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:35.446Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6727cf30a723a79f094f7d","title":"Discrete Choice Experiments: A Guide to Model Specification, Estimation and Software","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40273-017-0506-4","abstract":"We provide a user guide on the analysis of data (including best–worst and best–best data) generated from discrete-choice experiments (DCEs), comprising a theoretical review of the main choice models followed by practical advice on estimation and post-estimation.

Various exposures to heavy metals can lead to toxicity and oxidative stress. While glutathione-S-transferases are known as oxidative stress-related genes and involved in metal biotransformation. The aim of the present study is to investigate the correlation of GSTM1 polymorphism in MS patients and the possible association with blood concentration of arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) as major heavy metal pollutants. This study included 69 relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis patients and 74 age/gender-matched healthy subjects. The genetic profile was analyzed by PCR, and heavy metal concentrations were measured by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. Our results demonstrated that patients with the GSTM1 null genotype had considerably lower age of onset. However, the frequency of the GSTM1 null genotype was not significantly different between MS and control groups. In addition, the blood As and Cd concentrations were considerably higher in MS patients in comparison with healthy individuals. Also, it revealed that the GSTM1 null genotype associated with high Cd level in MS patients. There was also a trend toward an increase in As level in MS patients. These data may point to susceptibility to cadmium toxicity especially in RR–MS patients with smoking habit. Furthermore, the M1 null genotype will help in a prognosis of MS considering the age of onset. It confirms that the long-term prognosis in MS and patient’s disability are influenced by their ability to remove the toxic products and perhaps to decrease oxidative stress.","year":"2017","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:39.522Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:39.522Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6727cf30a723a79f094f7f","title":"2015 Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy: Guidelines for Renal Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41100-017-0114-y","abstract":"Renal anemia is a complication of chronic kidney disease. Guidelines for safe and effective treatment in patients with renal anemia are needed. The Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy (JSDT) published guidelines for the treatment of renal anemia in chronic hemodialysis patients in 2004 and in hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, predialysis, and pediatric patients in 2008. These two publications provide excellent guidance with respect to clinical practice issues, including the definition and diagnosis of renal anemia, the criteria for the initiation of treatment, target hemoglobin levels, iron supplementation therapy, blood transfusion, and side effects. The guidelines significantly improved the treatment of renal anemia in Japan. However, since 2008, many studies have assessed the treatment of renal anemia, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are now available. Therefore, the Executive Board of the JSDT decided that it was time to revise the guidelines to make them more appropriate to the situation of chronic kidney disease patients in Japan. This is the third edition of the guidelines for renal anemia published by the JSDT. The purpose is to improve the prognosis of chronic kidney disease patients, including after renal transplantation, through the treatment of renal anemia. The intended users of the guidelines are all healthcare professionals engaged in the treatment of chronic kidney disease. Regarding the treatment of adult dialysis and predialysis patients, statements and commentary are provided in the context of answers to clinical questions in Chapter 2 (Target Hb level and criteria for starting renal anemia treatment) and Chapter 4 (Evaluation of iron status and iron therapy). Furthermore, the essential information is provided alongside the critical issues in Chapter 1 (Diagnosis of renal anemia), Chapter 3 (Administration of ESAs—administration route and dose), Chapter 5 (ESA hyporesponsiveness), Chapter 6 (Side effects and concomitant symptoms of ESAs), and Chapter 7 (Red blood cell transfusion).

VKAs are mainly used for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism. In the past 5&nbsp;years, four new agents—the direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran [collectively known as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or non-VKA oral anticoagulants]—have been approved for these and other indications. Despite these new treatment options, the VKA warfarin currently remains the most frequently prescribed oral anticoagulant. The availability of DOACs provides an alternative management option for patients with AF, especially when the treating physician is hesitant to prescribe a VKA owing to associated limitations, such as food and drug interactions, and concerns about bleeding complications. Currently available real-world evidence shows that DOACs have similar or improved effectiveness and safety outcomes compared with warfarin. Treatment decisions on which DOAC is best suited for which patient to maximize safety and effectiveness should take into account not only clinically relevant patient characteristics but also patient preference.

However, the effectiveness and safety of using anticoagulants is highly dependent on the patient’s ability to manage and take these complex, high-risk medicines. This structured narrative review explores the published literature to identify the factors underpinning patients’ non-adherence to anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation (AF), and subsequently contemplates to what extent the DOACs might overcome the known challenges with traditional warfarin therapy. This review comprised a two-tier search of various databases and search platforms (CINAHL, Cochrane, Current Contents Connect, EMBASE, MEDLINE Ovid, EBSCO, PubMed, Google, Google Scholar) to yield 47 articles reporting patients perspectives on, and patients adherence to, anticoagulant therapy. The findings from the literature were synthesised under five interacting dimensions of adherence: therapy-related factors, patient-related factors, condition-related factors, social–economic factors and health system factors. Factors negatively affecting patients’ day-to-day lives (especially regular therapeutic drug monitoring, dose adjustments, dietary considerations) predominantly underpin a patient’s reluctance to take warfarin therapy, leading to non-adherence. Other patient-related factors underpinning non-adherence include patients’ perceptions and knowledge about the purpose of anticoagulation; understanding of the risks and benefits of therapy; socioeconomic status; and expectations of care from health professionals. In considering these findings, it is apparent that the DOACs may overcome some of the barriers to traditional warfarin therapy at least to an extent, particularly the need for regular monitoring, frequent dose adjustment and dietary considerations. However, their high cost, twice-daily dosing and gastrointestinal adverse effects may present additional challenges for patients and health systems. The review highlights the need to explicitly incorporate patients’ perspectives in decision-making processes for anticoagulant selection, to obtain optimum adherence and treatment outcomes. Further studies should explore resources that can better engage patients in decision making around the selection of anticoagulant therapy.","year":"2016","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:39.522Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:39.522Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6727d530a723a79f094f88","title":"Incorporating food addiction into disordered eating: the disordered eating food addiction nutrition guide (DEFANG)","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40519-016-0344-y","abstract":"Although not formally recognized by the DSM-5, food addiction (FA) has been well described in the scientific literature.

Integrating the concept of FA into the scope of disordered eating has been challenging for ED treatment professionals, since there is no well-accepted treatment model. The confusion surrounding the implications of FA, as well as the impact of the contemporary Westernized diet, may contribute to poor treatment outcomes. The purpose of this review is twofold. The first is to briefly explore the relationships between EDs and addictions, and the second is to propose a new model of conceptualizing and treating EDs that incorporates recent data on FA.

For various reasons, it is important to consider patients’ preferences regarding type of medication, particularly in view of the established relationship between preferences towards treatment, associated burden of treatment, and treatment adherence. This review aimed to systematically analyse the scientific literature assessing the preferences of AF patients with regard to long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment.We searched the MEDLINE, Scopus and EMBASE databases (from 1980 to 2015), added records from reference lists of publications found, and conducted a systematic review based on all identified publications. Outcomes of interest included any quantitative information regarding the opinions or preferences of AF patients towards OAC treatment, ideally specified according to different clinical or convenience attributes describing different OAC treatment options.Overall, 27 publications describing the results of studies conducted in 12 different countries were included in our review. Among these, 16 studies analysed patient preferences towards OACs in general. These studies predominantly assessed which benefits (mainly lower stroke risk) AF patients would require to tolerate harms (mainly higher bleeding risk) associated with an OAC. Most studies showed that patients were willing to accept higher bleeding risks if a certain threshold in stroke risk reduction could be reached. Nevertheless, most of the publications also showed that the preferences of AF patients towards OACs may differ from the perspective of clinical guidelines or the perspective of physicians. The remaining 11 studies included in our review assessed the preferences of AF patients towards specific OAC medication options, namely NOACs versus VKAs. Our review showed that AF patients prefer easy-to-administer treatments, such as treatments that are applied once daily without any food/drug interactions and without the need for bridging and frequent blood controls.Stroke risk reduction and a moderate increase in the risk of bleeding are the most important attributes for an AF patient when deciding whether they are for or against OAC treatment. If different anticoagulation options have similar clinical characteristics, convenience attributes matter to patients. In this review, AF patients favour attribute levels that describe NOAC treatment.","year":"2016","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:45.357Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:58:45.357Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6727d530a723a79f094f8c","title":"Exchange of Sex for Drugs or Money in Adolescents and Young Adults: An Examination of Sociodemographic Factors, HIV-Related Risk, and Community Context","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10900-016-0234-2","abstract":"The goal of this research was to examine associations among sociodemographic factors, HIV risk, and community context (e.g., economic insecurity, job training, housing instability, crime victimization, and perceived community norms) in adolescents and young adults who ever exchanged sex for drugs or money.

There is no significant differences between CYP2C19 allele variants for warfarin stable dose and INR > 5 event. Because of the complete linkage disequilibrium between CYP2C19*2,*17 and CYP2C9*1, patient with CYP2C19 *2/*2, *2/*17 and *17/*17 genotypes tend to have higher warfarin dose than patient with CYP2C19*1/*1 genotype. Stepwise regression analysis showed that VKORC1, CYP2C9, body mass index (BMI), age and gender were included as a factor significantly contributing to warfarin dose, whereas CYP2C19 did not contribute to warfarin dose. No statistically significant interaction between CYP2C9 and VKORC1 on warfarin dose and INR > 5 event was detected in univariate general linear model analysis.

Oral mucosa changes such as stomatitis or lichenoid reactions can be the first evidence of a contact allergy, with oral lichenoid reactions after contact with dental restorations, especially amalgam fillings, being among the most common clinical reactions. Additives in foods and oral hygiene products may also cause allergic mucosal reactions. Subjective symptoms, such as pain, burning feeling, or dryness of the oral mucosa, as well as cheilitis or lip and facial swelling, may not only have an allergic component but may also be associated with other diseases that have to be excluded. A complete and thorough clinical examination of the oral mucosa is the first step in the diagnosis of a contact allergy. A detailed history of the patient’s oral care products, drugs, and dental materials is both essential and helpful for the clinician. As a result of the presence of mucosal changes, a patch test can be used for the diagnosis of contact allergy of delayed type. Although the patch test is the standard diagnostic tool for such types of contact allergy, proper interpretation of patch-test results and their clinical relevance can be challenging. As the number of patients with allergies resulting from different materials increases over the years, and a larger number of different dental materials are found to induce an allergy, it is essential for dentists to be aware of the possible allergic reactions to dental materials. Thus, we aimed to develop a systematic approach for contact allergy of the oral cavity, focusing not only on clinical manifestations and diagnosis but also on management and prediction of the risk of oral allergic reactions.

Its prevalence ranges between 7 and 27&nbsp;% in men and 9–43&nbsp;% in women. The role of a pharmacist is to educate the patient on medications administration scheme, and drug interactions with particular food or food components. Aim of the review To assess a potential impact of food and fruit juice on the pharmacokinetic and therapeutic effects of medications used in treating overactive bladder syndrome. This information will enhance pharmaceutical care and is vital and helpful for pharmacists counseling their patients. Method In order to gather information on interactions of medications employed in bladder dysfunctions, the English language reports published in the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and CINAHL database over the years 1996–2015 were studied. Additionally, other resources, namely drugs.com, Medscape, UpToDate, Micromedex, Medical Letter, as well as Stockley Drugs Interaction electronic publication were included in the study. The analysis also covered product data sheets for particular medicinal products. Results Meals and the consumption of grapefruit juice were found to exert a diversified effect on the pharmacokinetics of drugs employed in overactive bladder syndrome therapy. Neither tolterodine, nor mirabegron interact with food and citrus fruit juice, whereas darifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin and solifenacin do interact with grapefruit and others citrus fruit juice. The effects of such interactions may potentially be negative to patients. Trospium absorption is significantly decreased by food. Conclusion For selected medicines used in treating bladder dysfunctions food and grapefruit juice consumption may significantly affect efficacy and safety of the therapy.

In addition, patients with breast cancer and different TCM constitutions may have different degrees of myelosuppression after chemotherapy. Some studies have revealed that some constitutions may become predictive factors for death and morbidity of some diseases. The study was to investigate the risk factors among TCM constitutions for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients with primary breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.From September 2008 to January 2014, 612 patients who underwent surgery and chemotherapy for breast cancer in three hospitals in Xi’an, Shanxi province, underwent TCM constitution assessment using the Nine Basic Constitutions in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire before chemotherapy. CINV was monitored during treatments. Patients were asked to complete the Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire. The most severe CINV grade during chemotherapy was recorded according to the WHO standard. The relationships between TCM constitutions, CINV, and clinical and pathological characteristics of the cancers were assessed.There were no differences in the incidence of CINV among breast cancer patients receiving different chemotherapy regimens, and among patients with different TCM constitutions.

In addition, the establishment of a reliable human bleeding model to test novel inhibitors of the coagulation cascade has proved challenging. Although routine monitoring of anticoagulant levels is not necessary in patients taking NOACs, anticoagulant reversal and a means of measuring reversal may be required for patients who present with bleeding or require urgent surgery. Prothrombin complex concentrates are pooled plasma products containing varying amounts of inactive vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in addition to vitamin K-dependent proteins and can replenish factors in the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation cascade, reversing an anticoagulant effect. Only one agent, idarucizumab, has been approved for rapid reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation and one more agent, andexanet alfa, has been submitted for approval to reverse the anticoagulatory effects of direct and indirect factor Xa inhibitors.This review discusses the laboratory tests available for assessing anticoagulation, human models of bleeding, and the use of current strategies—including prothrombin complex concentrates for reversal of anticoagulation by NOACs—to manage bleeding in patients.","year":"2016","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:59:03.482Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:59:03.482Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6727e730a723a79f094fb5","title":"Effects of Lemon and Seville Orange Juices on the Pharmacokinetic Properties of Sildenafil in Healthy Subjects","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40268-016-0140-1","abstract":"Several severe drug interactions have been reported when sildenafil, a potent drug for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, is co-administered with drugs or herbal remedies that inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4.

Additionally, Seville orange juice significantly reduced the apparent oral clearance of sildenafil by 30&nbsp;% (90&nbsp;% CI 63–75) without affecting its elimination half-life. In contrast, lemon juice did not cause any significant alterations in the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil. There was no significant treatment-related adverse effects reported during the study.Although it is considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, Seville orange only caused a mild increase in exposure to sildenafil after a single oral dose, without manifestation of any adverse effects. The enhanced bioavailability of sildenafil by Seville orange may be attributed to inhibition of its intestinal first-pass effect (CYP3A4 and or p-glycoprotein). Lemon juice, in contrast, had no effects on the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil.","year":"2016","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:59:03.482Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:59:03.482Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6727ec30a723a79f094fb6","title":"Examining the Efficacy of HIV Risk-Reduction Counseling on the Sexual Risk Behaviors of a National Sample of Drug Abuse Treatment Clients: Analysis of Subgroups","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-016-1300-6","abstract":"HIV counseling with testing has been part of HIV prevention in the U.S. since the 1980s.

The main signaling pathway regulating GSK3 activity through serine-phosphorylation is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1)/Akt relay that catalyzes serine-phosphorylation and thus inactivation of GSK3.

As a result, heparin products must be immediately withdrawn and replaced by alternative anticoagulants to compensate for the thrombotic risk associated with HIT. Limitations exist with the only currently FDA approved heparin alternative, argatroban. NOACs have been considered as potential alternatives to traditional agents based on their pharmacologic activity. Case reports have indicated positive results in patients, with clinical outcomes and tolerability supporting the use of the NOACs as alternative agents in the treatment of HIT.

The complexity of decision-making has been associated with a reluctance by health professionals to use antithrombotic therapy, leading to poor clinical outcomes. In order to improve stroke prevention in patients with AF, the contemporary perspectives of health professionals on the decision-making around antithrombotic therapy needs exploration. Objective To elicit emerging themes describing health professionals’ perspectives on the decision-making around antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in patients with AF. Setting Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia. Method A qualitative study based on face-to-face interviews was conducted from August to October 2014. Seven pharmacists, seven specialists, six general practitioners and six nurses practising in the Sydney metropolitan area and managing antithrombotic therapy for AF were interviewed until theme saturation was achieved in each subgroup. Interview transcripts were analysed using manual inductive coding. Main outcome measure Emerging themes describing health professionals’ perspectives on the decision-making around antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in patients with AF. Results Three overarching themes emerged. (1) Comprehensive assessment is necessary for decision-making but is not always implemented. Health professionals mostly focused on stroke risk assessment, not on the bleeding risk and medication safety issues. (2) Health professionals from different disciplines have different preferences for antithrombotic therapies. Although the majority of health professionals considered warfarin as the first-line therapy, NOACs were preferred by neurologists and haematologists. (3) Health professionals focused on different aspects of the decision making process: GPs and specialists were concerned about the appropriate prescription of antithrombotics, while pharmacists and nurses focused on daily medication management by patients. Conclusion The decision-making process appears to be partially preference based rather than systematic, and health professionals from various disciplines focus on different parts of the decision-making process.","year":"2016","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:59:08.454Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:59:08.454Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6727ec30a723a79f094fbd","title":"Minimizing the Risk of Bleeding with NOACs in the Elderly","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40266-016-0376-z","abstract":"Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban have gained a lot of popularity as alternatives to warfarin for anticoagulation in various clinical settings. However, there is conflicting opinion regarding the absolute benefit of NOAC use in elderly patients. Low body mass, altered body composition of fat and muscle, renal impairment and concurrent presence of multiple comorbidities predispose elderly patients to many adverse effects with NOACs that are typically not seen in younger patients. There have been reports that NOAC use, in particular dabigatran, is associated with a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in the elderly. Diagnosis and management of NOAC-associated bleeding in the elderly is difficult due to the absence of commonly available drug-specific antidotes that can rapidly reverse the anticoagulant effects. Moreover, in elderly patients, a number of factors such as the presence of other comorbid medical conditions, renal insufficiency, drug interactions from polypharmacy, risk of falls and dementia need to be considered before prescribing anticoagulation therapy. Elderly patients frequently have compromised renal function, and therefore dose adjustments according to creatinine clearance for NOACs need to be made. As each NOAC comes with its own unique advantages and safety profile, an individualized case by case approach should be adopted to decide on the appropriate anticoagulation regimen for elderly patients after weighing the overall risks and benefits of therapy.","year":"2016","createdAt":"2020-09-20T09:59:08.454Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T09:59:08.454Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6727ec30a723a79f094fbe","title":"Particularities of allergy in the Tropics","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40413-016-0110-7","abstract":"Allergic diseases are distributed worldwide and their risk factors and triggers vary according to geographical and socioeconomic conditions.

To overcome these limitations, a novel, porous, quickly disintegrating, and easier-to-swallow fast-melt formulation based on powder-liquid, three-dimensional printing (3DP) technology has been developed.To determine and compare the relative bioavailability of a novel 3DP fast melt containing levetiracetam in healthy male and female subjects.This study included 33 subjects in a three-way crossover design. The 3DP fast-melt formulation was compared against the conventional immediate-release tablet of levetiracetam (Keppra®) after a single 1000-mg dose administration under fasting conditions following the bioequivalence criteria used by the US Food and Drug Administration. This study also evaluated the food effect on the bioavailability of the levetiracetam 3DP fast melt. A small sip of liquid was used to administer the fast-melt formulation.The novel 3DP fast melt showed rapid oral disintegration (mean duration of 11&nbsp;s from a sip of water to completion of swallowing) following its administration, and did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam. A lower absorption peak was observed after administration of the 3DP fast melt under fed conditions, as expected. In addition, time of maximum measured plasma concentration was delayed by approximately 3.5&nbsp;h under fed conditions. These effects are unlikely to be of clinical significance with long-term administration, and may help reduce the adverse events and facilitate compliance. Finally, no change in the oral mucosa was observed with the 3DP fast melt while being as safe and well tolerated as the standard levetiracetam tablet.This study quantified the rapid disintegration of the 3DP levetiracetam fast melt and confirmed its equivalent rate and extent of absorption to the conventional immediate-release tablet in the fasted state, using standard bioequivalence criteria.","year":"2016","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:18.932Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:18.932Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67727e4d83dcf45b364e8e","title":"Red-Brown Urine Discolouration in Two Patients Taking Mesalamine","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40800-016-0029-5","abstract":"A 38-year-old male and a 36-year-old female experienced red-brown urine discolouration after 2 and 3&nbsp;days, respectively, during the use of mesalamine for inflammatory bowel disease.

These milestones address the knowledge, skills, abilities, attitudes, and experiences that a resident is expected to progress through during the course of training. Even prior to the initiation of the milestones, there was a paucity of EM literature addressing the remediation of problem resident behaviors and there remain few readily accessible tools to aid in the implementation of a remediation plan. The goal of the “Problem Resident Behavior Guide” is to provide specific strategies for resident remediation based on deficiencies identified within the framework of the EM milestones. The “Problem Resident Behavior Guide” is a written instructional manual that provides concrete examples of remediation strategies to address specific milestone deficiencies. The more than 200 strategies stem from the experiences of the authors who have professional experience at three different academic hospitals and emergency medicine residency programs, supplemented by recommendations from educational leaders as well as utilization of valuable education adjuncts, such as focused simulation exercises, lecture preparation, and themed ED shifts. Most recommendations require active participation by the resident with guidance by faculty to achieve the remediation expectations. The ACGME outcomes-based milestones aid in the identification of deficiencies with regards to resident performance without providing recommendations on remediation. The Problem Resident Behavior Guide can therefore have a significant impact by filling in this gap.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:18.932Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:18.932Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67727e4d83dcf45b364e93","title":"Pharmaceutical care program for onco-hematologic outpatients: safety, efficiency and patient satisfaction","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11096-015-0235-8","abstract":" Background Self-administration of oral chemotherapy regimens in the home setting leading to new challenges in the health system. Objective To develop and evaluate a comprehensive pharmaceutical care program for cancer outpatients treated with oral antineoplastic agents. Setting A Spanish tertiary hospital. Methods During 2012, a comprehensive pharmaceutical care program was elaborated following the standards recommended by ASCO. It comprised a standard procedure focusing on: drug indication, dosing regimen, required laboratory tests, route of administration, interactions with other current medications and adverse events; a checklist and informational brochures. A pharmaceutical follow up was defined and structured into three clinical interviews over 6&nbsp;months which focused on safety and efficiency outcomes. Patients starting treatment with oral antineoplastic agents during 2011 (control group) without pharmacist monitoring were compared to patients beginning treatment at some point in 2013 who were prospectively monitored by a pharmacist (intervention group). Statistical analysis was performed by the statistical program SPSS, 21.0 and p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.05 was considered significant. Main outcome measures Patient demographics and clinical data were recorded. The primary endpoint was safety outcomes: detection of drug related problems, drug interactions, and adverse events. Adherence, permanence and patient satisfaction were also collected. Results A total of 249 patients were enrolled in the study. Two hundred and seventy-five medication errors were recorded [106 in the control group and 169 in the intervention group (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.008)]. The pharmacist intervened in 362 occasions being accepted 88.8&nbsp;% of the time, mainly to reinforce patient education and literacy and giving information on co-administration with other drugs and herbal medicines.

In the absence of randomised comparative trials of switching to NOACs versus maintaining VKA treatment, several considerations argue in favour of a switching strategy. First, there is conclusive evidence that haemorrhagic strokes and intracranial bleedings are much fewer in number with NOACs than with warfarin. The risk of intracranial bleeding is 52&nbsp;% lower with NOACS than with warfarin, with extremes ranging from 33 to 70&nbsp;%. Such benefit is applicable to different NOACs, and independent of the time-in-therapeutic range under warfarin. Patients at increased risk for intra-cranial bleeding (renal dysfunction, or prior stroke or intra-cranial bleeding) should benefit most from switching to NOACs. Patients with labile International Normalized Ratio are also considered good candidates for switching because of their increased risk of stroke, and the lack of interactions between the effects of NOACs versus warfarin and the time-in-therapeutic range. Furthermore, some NOACs proved to be superior to warfarin in reducing the risk of thromboembolic complications even in intention-to-treat analyses. As further advantage, NOACs show fewer drug–drug and drug-food interactions when compared with warfarin. Last, but not least, NOACs do not need frequent blood drawings except in patients with moderate renal dysfunction, in whom periodic controls of serum creatinine are generally advised. The higher cost remains a barrier to a wider use of NOACs, especially in low-income settings.","year":"2016","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:18.932Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:18.932Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772824d83dcf45b364e95","title":"Opt-Out HIV Testing of Inmates in North Carolina Prisons: Factors Associated with not Wanting a Test and not Knowing They Were Tested","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-015-1203-y","abstract":"Opt-out HIV testing is recommended for correctional settings but may occur without inmates’ knowledge or against their wishes.

With the recent availability of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) it is of clinical interest to know if they are implicated with hair loss and/or whether they could be successfully prescribed for patients who suffer from coumarin- or heparin-related alopecia. Initially reports of heparin- and coumarin-associated alopecia available through PubMed and Medline were explored in order to establish the cause of this side effect. Currently there is a lack of unanimity on why anticoagulants cause alopecia. However, timing and presentation strongly suggest that telogen effluvium is part of the process. The observation that both heparins and coumarins cause a similar pattern of hair loss suggests a shared mechanism related to anticoagulant activity. To date, the World Health Organization has received 405 reports of DOAC-associated alopecia through their pharmacovigilance database VigiBase®. Additionally, real world registry&nbsp;data describes an alopecia incidence of 4.4 per 100 patient&nbsp;years in patients prescribed&nbsp;rivaroxaban and dabigatran.

This article focuses on the important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and clinical pearls of these therapies, providing practitioners with essential drug information to optimize pharmacotherapy in acutely ill neurocritical care patients.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:42.573Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:42.573Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772964d83dcf45b364ebc","title":"Genetic, familial and environmental correlates of asthma among early adolescents in Sri Lanka: a case control study","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40413-015-0068-x","abstract":"Despite advances in management, the mortality and morbidity due to asthma are increasing globally. Identification of specific correlates in the local context is useful in disease management. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and to describe selected correlates of asthma among12-14 year old school children in a district in Sri Lanka.A school based cross-sectional study was conducted using a self administered questionnaire. Multi-staged stratified cluster sampling was used to select 42 classes in grades 7, 8 and 9. “Current asthma” (CA)(case) was defined as ‘having Physician Diagnosed Asthma (PDA) and having had wheezing during the previous 12 months’. For each case, two healthy controls were selected from the same class to assess correlates. Information on correlates was collected by trained field midwives during home visits. Backward stepwise logistic regression model was used for analysis of correlates. Skin Prick Testing was carried out among asthmatics together with their healthy siblings using standard extracts of House Dust Mite (HDM), cockroach and Blomia. Ethical clearance was obtained from Ethical Review Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Colombo.Out of 1483 subjects participated, 753 were females (50.8%). The prevalence rates for current wheezing (CW), ever wheezing (EW), current asthma (CA), and physician diagnosed asthma (PDA) were 16.7%, 19.4%, 10.7% and 14.5% respectively. A total of 158 CA cases were identified. Information on correlates of asthma was collected for 145 CA cases (97.9%) and for 285 controls (96.6%). The unconfounded predictors of having CA among adolescents in the present sample were; only child in the family (OR = 4.2, 95% CI: 1.7-9.9); first born of the family (OR = 2.6 95% CI: 1.3-5.2); presence of allergic rhinitis (OR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.6-4.6); family history of asthma (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-3.2); family history of allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.2); family history of eczema (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.0-3.2). Higher risk of sensitization to cockroach, HDM and Blomia was seen among asthmatics compared to healthy siblings.A significant proportion of students reported to have asthma.

This article reviews the pharmacological properties of edoxaban as well as its tolerability and therapeutic efficacy in the treatment and prevention of recurrent VTE events. As demonstrated in the pivotal Hokusai-VTE phase&nbsp;III trial, once-daily edoxaban after initial treatment with heparin was non-inferior to standard therapy with heparin/warfarin in preventing recurrent VTE events and was associated with a significantly lower risk of clinically relevant bleeding than the traditional therapy. Edoxaban shares the advantages of other direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over traditional therapies, including the lack of requirement for routine coagulation monitoring, a rapid onset and offset of action, and few drug-drug interactions. It offers the convenience of once-daily dosing, can be taken without regard to food and allows for a dose reduction in patients with certain clinical features, such as moderate renal impairment or low body weight. In conclusion, edoxaban represents an effective and potentially safer alternative to traditional vitamin K antagonist therapy for the treatment and prevention of recurrent VTE. Its recent approval expands the range of DOAC agents for recurrent VTE, further facilitating treatment individualization.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:42.573Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:42.573Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772964d83dcf45b364ebe","title":"Preferences for anticoagulation therapy in atrial fibrillation: the patients’ view","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11239-015-1263-x","abstract":"Since the introduction of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs), besides vitamin-K antagonists, an additional option for stroke prevention of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is available.

Using a series of semi-structured interviews, we explored patients’ understanding and perception concerning the benefits and risks of antithrombotic treatment for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after joint replacement surgery.A series of semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients who had undergone knee or hip replacement surgery at a tertiary care hospital (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA) in 2014.

Two investigators independently coded and analyzed the data to identify important themes and concepts using the constant comparative method.Of 64 patients who were invited, 12 patients (19&nbsp;%) completed the interviews. The majority of patients (92&nbsp;%) were aware of the benefits of antithrombotic therapy for reducing the risk of blood clots, while less than half of them had a clear understanding of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. While all patients were aware of risk of minor bleeding, only 6 patients (50&nbsp;%) considered the risk of major bleeding as a possible side effect of antithrombotic treatment. Overall, patients perceived bleeding as a less important outcome than a thrombotic event. The lack of awareness about the risk of major bleeding, the assumption that a short-term exposure would not meaningfully affect bleeding risk, and the assumption that bleeding is a controllable event influenced their perception. Most patients (83&nbsp;%) stated that their decision to use antithrombotic medications was mainly based on the trust in their physician’s expertise.Patients perceived thrombotic events as more important outcomes than bleeding events. Patients’ understanding of thrombotic and bleeding events varies and may play a key role in their preferences.

The first strategy reflected national guideline adherence with the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (i.e. dabigatran etexilate), warfarin, and no treatment. The second strategy reflected observed stroke prophylaxis prior to 2012 with the utilization of warfarin, acetylsalicylic acid, and no treatment. A Danish health sector perspective was adopted. A Markov model was designed and populated with information on input parameters from the literature and local cost data reflecting 2014 values. A modeled patient cohort was constructed with a risk profile intended to reflect that of the Danish patient population with AF. The applied outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio amounted to €3557 per QALY for the guideline-adherent treatment strategy (GTS) compared with the pre-2012 treatment strategy. This ratio is below a threshold of €25,000 (£20,000) per QALY. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the result was largely robust to changes in input parameters.

Warfarin, the mainstay of stroke prevention in AF, increases the risk of major bleeding. Furthermore, warfarin therapy comes with several limitations including frequent monitoring and the need for dose adjustments, unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and the potential for significant drug-drug and food-drug interactions. The DOACs were developed to overcome these limitations while maintaining or surpassing warfarin’s efficacy and safety profiles. All four DOACs have similar or better efficacy and safety compared with warfarin and are therefore valuable alternatives for the prevention of stroke and SEE in patients with nonvalvular AF.

Objective To describe medicine-related problems (MRPs) experienced by SA and ME patients from their perspectives and identify possible contributory factors that may be specific to their cultures. Setting The data were collected in seven pharmacies in London, United Kingdom (UK). Method The study was a qualitative study. Patients were from SA and ME origins, aged over 18 and prescribed three or more regular medicines. Patients were identified when presenting with a prescription. The data were collected in 80 face-to-face semi-structured interviews using Gordon’s MRPs tool. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using Gordon’s coding frame and Nvivo 10 software. Main outcome measure Describing MRPs experienced by SA and ME patients from their perspectives and identifying possible contributory factors that may be specific to their cultures. Results Eighty participants (61&nbsp;% male) had mean (SD) age 58 (13.4) years and a mean (SD) of 8 (4) medicines. Interviews revealed that several factors contributed to the development of MRPs; some appeared to be specific to SA and ME cultures and others were similar to the general population. The factors that were reported to be specific to SA and ME groups comprised religious practices and beliefs, use of non-prescription medicines, extent of family support, and travelling abroad—to patient’s homeland or to take religious journeys. Illiteracy, language and communication barriers, lack of translated resources, perceptions of healthcare providers, and difficulty consulting a doctor of the same gender may also contribute to the problems. Many of these factors could be expected to influence patient’s safety, adherence, and informed decision-making. Conclusion This study demonstrated that SA and ME patients have their own problems and needs regarding both medicine use and service access. By uncovering particular problems experienced by these groups, the study can inform healthcare professionals to support SA and ME patients in the use of their medicines.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:52.528Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:52.528Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772a04d83dcf45b364ecf","title":"The expenditure of computer-related worktime using clinical decision support systems in chronic pain therapy","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12871-015-0094-9","abstract":"Estimate the expenditure of computer-related worktime resulting from the use of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) to prevent adverse drug reactions (ADR) among patients undergoing chronic pain therapy and compare the employed check systems with respect to performance and practicability.Data were collected retrospectively from 113 medical records of patients under chronic pain therapy during 2012/2013. Patient-specific medications were checked for potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) using two publicly available CDSS, Apotheken Umschau (AU) and Medscape (MS), and a commercially available CDSS AiDKlinik® (AID). The time needed to analyze patient pharmacotherapy for DDIs was taken with a stopwatch. Measurements included the time needed for running the analysis and printing the results. CDSS were compared with respect to the expenditure of time and usability. Only patient pharmacotherapies with at least two prescribed drugs and fitting the criteria of the corresponding CDSS were analyzed. Additionally, a qualitative evaluation of the used check systems was performed, employing a questionnaire asking five pain physicians to compare and rate the performance and practicability of the three CDSSs.The AU tool took a total of 3:55:45&nbsp;h with an average of 0:02:32&nbsp;h for 93 analyzed patient regimens and led to the discovery of 261 DDIs. Using the Medscape interaction checker required a total of 1:28:35&nbsp;h for 38 patients with an average of 0:01:58&nbsp;h and a yield of 178 interactions. The CDSS AID required a total of 3:12:27&nbsp;h for 97 patients with an average time of analysis of 0:01:59&nbsp;h and the discovery of 170 DDIs. According to the pain physicians the CDSS AID was chosen as the preferred tool.Applying a CDSS to examine a patients drug regimen for potential DDIs causes an average extra expenditure of work time of 2:09&nbsp;min, which extends patient treatment time by 25&nbsp;% on average. Nevertheless, the authors believe that the extra expenditure of time employing a CDSS is outweighed by their benefits, including reduced ADR risks and safer clinical drug management.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:52.528Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:52.528Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772a04d83dcf45b364ed0","title":"Effect evaluation of an interprofessional medication therapy management approach for multimorbid patients in primary care: a cluster-randomized controlled trial in community care (WestGem study protocol)","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12875-015-0305-y","abstract":"Pharmaceutical practice worldwide is developing towards patient care.

After a 6&nbsp;month observation period, general practitioners (GP) are randomly allocated to one of three groups and the interprofessional medication therapy management approach is implemented sequentially per each group with a lag of 3&nbsp;months between. The primary outcome is the change in the quality of therapy measured by the MAI (Medication Appropriateness Index). Secondary outcomes include changes in the number of drug related problems, medication complexity, changes in drug-adherence, changes in health-status and function, quality of life, direct costs and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The acceptance of the interprofessional Medication Therapy Management approach is assessed by qualitative methods.The patient interview and brown bag review are activities, typically provided by the pharmacist. In this trial the patient is blinded to the pharmacist. The strength of having the patient blinded to the pharmacists is to exclude skepticism of the patient toward unknown pharmacies, which might be a major confounder in a regional and community setting.

However, understanding that the construction of a classification was necessary but not sufficient, we developed a mapping strategy in the attempt to better fit it to the ICD-11 linearization structure.The cross-linking terms process has been constructed based on an algorithm in which we prioritized the pre-coordination, followed by the post-coordination when the first step was not possible. If the above strategies failed to identify the entries, the conditions were ruled as “non specific terms”, “no code fit properly” or “missing terms”.Amongst the 652 terms distributed in 5 main groups of the Hypersensitivity/Allergic Diseases classification, 169 terms fit directly the codes listed in the ICD-11 beta draft (October 2014 version), 26 were considered as “nonspecific term”, 21 were linked to the Foundation by Index, 7 were recorded as inclusions and 2 were cited just in the definition of the condition. The post-coordination was possible for 97 terms, mainly for drug hypersensitivity conditions. We noticed a considerable number of allergen references missing.The proposed strategy of cross-linking terms and the results of this process can actively contribute to updating the hypersensitivity and allergic conditions classification in the ICD-11 beta revision and underlines the need for either a new chapter in ICD-11 possibly entitled Hypersensitivity / Allergic Disorders or at the very least the aggregation of all such diseases under the “Diseases of Immune System” chapter in order for the overlaps to be double parented to the appropriate ‘system’ chapters.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:58.986Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:58.986Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772a64d83dcf45b364ed5","title":"Use of Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Special Patient Populations with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: A Review of the Literature and Application to Clinical Practice","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40265-015-0405-y","abstract":"Atrial fibrillation is a commonly encountered arrhythmia associated with increased risk for thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation is necessary to decrease the risk of ischemic stroke. Traditionally, warfarin has been the only oral pharmacotherapeutic option for long-term anticoagulation in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Recently, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC), including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, have become available as alternatives for warfarin in the prevention of stroke in patients with NVAF. Recently published atrial fibrillation guidelines contain new recommendations for risk stratification tools in determining the need for anticoagulant therapy and incorporate NOAC pharmacotherapy options for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF. NOACs offer several advantages over warfarin, including the elimination of routine laboratory monitoring, fewer drug and food interactions, and rapid therapeutic onset and offset. However, the lack of antidote in the case of serious bleeding and lack of data for long-term use in patient populations at risk for bleeding is problematic. Older adults are at high risk for thromboembolic and bleeding events as a result of anticoagulation and require special consideration when selecting anticoagulant therapy. The risk of drug accumulation and bleeding is concerning in the presence of renal impairment. The objective of this review is to provide the clinician with an update on the use of NOACs for NVAF, focusing on older adults and patients with renal impairment in light of recently published atrial fibrillation guidelines. Available data on using NOACs in coronary artery stenting, cardioversion, and ablation are also reviewed.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:58.986Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:58.986Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772a64d83dcf45b364ed6","title":"The Impact of Risk Stratification of Venous Thromboembolism on Complexity and Site of Management","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40138-015-0073-y","abstract":"Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is a disease state with a high incidence, producing substantial morbidity and mortality.

People informed about the study came to the research site and completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview and instructions for pill counting. Over the next 5&nbsp;weeks participants received three unscheduled follow-up phone assessments conducted 2&nbsp;weeks apart to collect pill counts of their HIV medication.

The analytic approach was phenomenological and grounded in the narratives rather than based on an a priori theoretical framework. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim by research staff and entered into ATLAS.ti 6, a qualitative data-management software package, prior to analysis. Teen relationships were found to vary along a Dis-Continuum from casual hookups to “official” boyfriend/girlfriend. There was a lack of consensus, and much ambiguity, as to the substantive meaning of different relationships. Labeling dating relationships seem to facilitate acquisition of important developmental needs such as identity, affiliation, and status, while attempting to manage cognitive dissonance and emotional disappointments. Findings underscore the confusion and complexity surrounding contemporary adolescent dating. Adolescent girls are using language and social media to assist them in meeting developmental goals. Sometimes their dating labels are adaptive, other times they are a cause of stress, or concealment of unmet needs and thwarted desires. Programs focused on positive youth development need to resonate with the realities of teens’ lives and more fully acknowledge the complicated dynamics of teen dating relationships and how they are formalized, publicized and negotiated.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:58.986Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:17:58.986Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772a64d83dcf45b364ed9","title":"How to Use Warfarin Assays in Patient Management: Analysis of 437 Warfarin Measurements in a Clinical Setting","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40262-014-0219-1","abstract":"Approximately 50&nbsp;% of inter-individual variation in warfarin dose requirements is attributed to the polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 (CYP2C9) and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1) genotypes.

Recently, novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) that do not require regular monitoring offer an alternative to warfarin. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether cost effectiveness of NOACs for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation depends on the quality of warfarin control.We developed a Markov decision model to simulate warfarin treatment outcomes in relation to the quality of anticoagulation control, expressed as percentage of time in the therapeutic range (TTR). Standard treatment with adjusted-dose warfarin and improved anticoagulation control by genotype-guided dosing were compared with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. The analysis was performed from the Slovenian healthcare payer perspective using 2014 costs.In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban was below the threshold of €25,000 per quality-adjusted life-years compared with adjusted-dose warfarin with a TTR of 60&nbsp;%. The probability that warfarin was a cost-effective option was around 1&nbsp;%. This percentage rises as the quality of anticoagulation control improves. At a TTR of 70&nbsp;%, warfarin was the preferred treatment in half the iterations.The cost effectiveness of NOACs for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are at increased risk for stroke is highly sensitive to warfarin anticoagulation control.

Warfarin therapy can be difficult to manage safely in this population because of its narrow therapeutic index, multiple drug and dietary interactions, small patient size, high-risk cardiac indications, and lack of data to support anticoagulation recommendations. We sought to describe our institution’s effort to develop a dedicated cardiac anticoagulation service to address the special needs of this population and to review the literature. In 2009, in response to Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals for Anticoagulation, Boston Children’s Hospital created a dedicated pediatric Cardiac Anticoagulation Monitoring Program (CAMP). The primary purpose was to provide centralized management of outpatient anticoagulation to cardiac patients, to serve as a disease-specific resource to families and providers, and to devise strategies to evolve clinical care with rapidly emerging trends in anticoagulation care. Over 5&nbsp;years the CAMP Service, staffed by a primary pediatric cardiology attending, a full-time nurse practitioner, and administrative assistant with dedicated support from pharmacy and nutrition, has enrolled over 240 patients ranging in age from 5&nbsp;months to 55&nbsp;years. The most common indications include a prosthetic valve (34&nbsp;%), Fontan prophylaxis (20&nbsp;%), atrial arrhythmias (11&nbsp;%), cardiomyopathy (10&nbsp;%), Kawasaki disease (7&nbsp;%), and a ventricular assist device (2&nbsp;%).

Pediatric-specific guidelines for VKOR1 and CYP2C9 pharmacogenomics testing, procedural bridging with enoxaparin, novel anticoagulant use, and quality metrics have been developed. Program satisfaction is rated highly among families and providers.

The findings are consistent with the transdiagnostic approach and indicate that a single, as yet unspecified factor may account for the shared variance across cognitive and behavioural maintenance processes.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:02.546Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:02.546Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772aa4d83dcf45b364ee1","title":"Management of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria in the Elderly","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40266-015-0249-x","abstract":"The guidelines for the management of urticaria in adults and children have been revised and updated recently. However, there are few data in the literature concerning several aspects of this disease in the elderly (e.g., epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, clinical aspects, association with co-morbidities, efficacy and safety profiles of treatments, and management strategies). This is an obvious deficiency in the data, as this disease causes a deterioration in quality of life, affecting the quality of sleep, everyday life habits and activities, and inducing severe disability. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) can also be associated with internal, infectious, autoimmune, or neoplastic diseases. It is therefore necessary to pay particular attention to these clinical issues through appropriate clinical examinations. At the same time, the specific features of medications used to treat CSU in the elderly should be carefully evaluated, as its pharmacological treatment raises a number of problems related both to the clinical condition of the patient and to concomitant diseases, as well as to the polypharmacotherapy, which is common in older subjects and may cause safety problems because of the drug interactions. Non-sedating new-generation antihistamines are the mainstay treatment of CSU for the elderly. The efficacy and safety of alternative treatment options have not been assessed in the geriatric population with CSU; corticosteroids and cyclosporine (ciclosporin) should be used by this population with extreme caution. Similarly, there are no data regarding the actual safety profile of the new-generation antihistamines at higher doses than those recommended in elderly patients.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:02.546Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:02.546Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772aa4d83dcf45b364ee2","title":"Nurses’ self-reported time estimation of anticoagulation therapy: a survey of warfarin management in long-term care","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12912-015-0058-x","abstract":"A nursing shortage in the United States has resulted in increased workloads, potentially affecting the quality of care. This situation is particularly concerning in long-term care (LTC) facilities, where residents are older, frailer, and may be receiving multiple medications for comorbidities, thus requiring a greater commitment of nurse time. We conducted a survey of LTC nurses to determine how much of their time each week is spent managing newly started and stable warfarin-treated residents.Forty LTC nurses validated the questionnaire to determine what protocols/procedures are involved in warfarin management. Twenty LTC nurses completed the survey, quantifying the time they spend on procedures related to warfarin management, and how often they performed each procedure for each resident each week.The nurses reported that 26% of their residents were receiving warfarin; the majority (approximately 75%) of these residents began warfarin after admission to the facility. On average, the nurses spent 4.6&nbsp;hours per week for treatment procedures and monitoring patients initiating warfarin therapy and 2.35&nbsp;hours per week for each resident who was stable on warfarin therapy on admission. Overall, to care for an average number of newly initiated and stable warfarin patients in a medium-size LTC facility, staff nurses are estimated to spend 68&nbsp;hours per week.Study limitations include the potential for bias because of the small sample size, representativeness of the sample, and the possibility of inaccuracies in respondents’ self-reported time estimation of warfarin-related procedures.In the context of a well-documented and expanding nursing shortage in the United States, the substantial use of time and resources necessary to initiate, monitor, and manage warfarin treatment in elderly LTC patients is of concern. Until the problem of understaffing is resolved, implementation of therapies that are simpler and require less nursing time—e.g. the use of new oral anticoagulants in the place of warfarin—may be a way to free up nursing time for other essential care tasks.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:02.546Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:02.546Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772aa4d83dcf45b364ee3","title":"Selection of Warfarin or One of the New Oral Antithrombotic Agents for Long-Term Prevention of Stroke among Persons with Atrial Fibrillation","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11940-014-0331-4","abstract":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disorder, which can potentially increases the risk of stroke by five-fold, thus, resulting in high public healthcare burden. Stroke prevention is vital in the management of AF patients. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA, eg, warfarin) have been the mainstay treatment to prevent ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolism in AF patients for several decades. Despite the efficacy of warfarin, its limitations have recently driven the advent of some new antithrombotic agents, the non-VKA oral anticoagulant (NOACs, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). The NOACs have changed the landscape for thromboembolic prophylaxis among patients with nonvalvular AF. Although three NOACs thus far (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) have been approved in Europe and the United States, for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF on the basis of several Phase III clinical trials, warfarin still remain important in preventing stroke for patients. This is especially true for those with optimal control of international normalized ratio with high (>70&nbsp;%) time in therapeutic range, valvular AF or associated prosthetic valve. These NOACs are attractive alternatives for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF who are unable or unwilling to receive warfarin. However, several issues should be taken into consideration on safe and effective use of these NOACs in day-to-day clinical practice, for example, pharmacological properties, drug interactions, monitoring and compliance, and treatment of frail elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, etc. The decision about whether to initiate oral anticoagulation either with warfarin or NOACs should be patient-centered and after consideration of both stroke and bleeding risks. It is important for clinical practitioner to offer patients with AF an individualized decision about drug choice, making decision after adequate patient education plus discussion about the risks and benefits of these agents, thus fitting the drug to the patient profile.","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:02.546Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:02.546Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772aa4d83dcf45b364ee4","title":"Stroke and Systemic Embolism Prevention in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in Belgium: Comparative Cost Effectiveness of New Oral Anticoagulants and Warfarin","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40261-014-0253-7","abstract":"Management of non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) focuses on the use of anticoagulation to mitigate the risk of stroke. Until recently, vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment was considered the standard of care, with the emergence of non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) shifting treatment practice. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the use of warfarin and the NOACs for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF from the perspective of a Belgian healthcare payer using a cost-effectiveness analysis and the efficiency frontier approach.A previously published Markov model was adapted to the Belgian healthcare setting. Clinical events modelled include ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, systemic embolism, intracranial haemorrhage, other major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular hospitalisation and treatment discontinuations. Efficacy and bleeding data for warfarin and apixaban 5&nbsp;mg twice daily were obtained from the ARISTOTLE trial, whilst those for other NOACs (rivaroxaban 20&nbsp;mg once daily, dabigatran 110&nbsp;mg twice daily, dabigatran 150&nbsp;mg twice daily) were from published indirect comparisons. Acute medical costs were obtained from reimbursement payments made to Belgian hospitals, whilst long-term medical costs and utility data were derived from the literature. The efficiency frontier was calculated using total costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as outcomes. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.Warfarin and apixaban were the two optimal treatment choices, as the other three treatment alternatives including dabigatran 110&nbsp;mg, dabigatran 150&nbsp;mg switching to dabigatran 110&nbsp;mg at the age of 80 years and rivaroxaban were extendedly or strictly dominated on the efficiency frontier. Apixaban was a cost-effective alternative vs warfarin at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €7,212/QALY gained.Amongst NOACs, apixaban may be the most economically efficient alternative to warfarin in NVAF patients who are suitable for VKA treatment and eligible for stroke prevention in Belgium.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:02.546Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:02.546Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772aa4d83dcf45b364ee5","title":"Tedizolid: A Novel Oxazolidinone with Potent Activity Against Multidrug-Resistant Gram-Positive Pathogens","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40265-015-0352-7","abstract":"Tedizolid phosphate is a novel oxazolidinone prodrug (converted to the active form tedizolid by phosphatases in vivo) that has been developed and recently approved (June 2014) by the United States FDA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) caused by susceptible Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Tedizolid is an oxazolidinone, but differs from other oxazolidinones by possessing a modified side chain at the C-5 position of the oxazolidinone nucleus which confers activity against certain linezolid-resistant pathogens and has an optimized C- and D-ring system that improves potency through additional binding site interactions. The mechanism of action of tedizolid is similar to other oxazolidinones and occurs through inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. As with other oxazolidinones, the spontaneous frequency of resistance development to tedizolid is low. Tedizolid is four- to eightfold more potent in vivo than linezolid against all species of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci, including drug-resistant phenotypes such as MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and linezolid-resistant phenotypes. Importantly, tedizolid demonstrates activity against linezolid-resistant bacterial strains harboring the horizontally transmissible cfr gene, in the absence of certain ribosomal mutations conferring reduced oxazolidinone susceptibility. With its half-life of approximately 12&nbsp;h, tedizolid is dosed once daily. It demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics, has a high oral bioavailability of approximately 90&nbsp;%, and is primarily excreted by the liver as an inactive, non-circulating sulphate conjugate. Tedizolid does not require dosage adjustment in patients with any degree of renal dysfunction or hepatic dysfunction. Studies in animals have demonstrated that the pharmacodynamic parameter most closely associated with the efficacy of tedizolid is fAUC0–24h/MIC. In non-neutropenic animals, a dose-response enhancement was observed with tedizolid and lower exposures were required compared to neutropenic cohorts. Two Phase III clinical trials have demonstrated non-inferiority of a once-daily tedizolid 200&nbsp;mg dose for 6–10&nbsp;days versus twice-daily 600&nbsp;mg linezolid for the treatment of ABSSSIs. Both trials used the primary endpoint of early clinical response at 48–72&nbsp;h; however, one trial compared oral formulations while the other initiated therapy with the parenteral formulation and allowed oral sequential therapy following initial clinical response. Throughout its development, tedizolid has demonstrated that it is well tolerated and animal studies have shown a lower propensity for neuropathies with long-term use than its predecessor linezolid. Data from the two completed Phase III clinical trials demonstrated that the studied tedizolid regimen (200&nbsp;mg once daily for 6&nbsp;days) had significantly less impact on hematologic parameters as well as significantly less gastrointestinal treatment-emergent adverse effects (TEAEs) than its comparator linezolid. As with linezolid, tedizolid is a weak, reversible MAO inhibitor; however, a murine head twitch model validated to assess serotonergic activity reported no increase in the number of head twitches with tedizolid even at doses that exceeded the C max in humans by up to 25-fold. Tyramine and pseudoephedrine challenge studies in humans have also reported no meaningful MAO-related interactions with tedizolid. With its enhanced in vitro activity against a broad-spectrum of Gram-positive aerobic bacteria, convenient once-daily dosing, a short 6-day course of therapy, availability of both oral and intravenous routes of administration, and an adverse effect profile that appears to be more favorable than linezolid, tedizolid is an attractive agent for use in both the hospital and community settings. Tedizolid is currently undergoing additional Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilated nosocomial pneumonia (VNP).","year":"2015","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:02.546Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:02.546Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772b84d83dcf45b364ef8","title":"The economic burden of diabetes in India: a review of the literature","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12992-014-0080-x","abstract":"Diabetes and its complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in India, and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is on the rise.

Methods A cross-sectional study using a pretested self-administered survey was conducted among a random sample of community pharmacists. The survey included three knowledge questions relevant to counseling diabetic patients during Ramadan. Questions covered the recommended timing and dosing for metformin and insulin as well as the safe blood glucose range required for diabetic patients to safely continue their fast. Using logistic regression, a model was estimated to predict pharmacists’ willingness to attend a workshop on the adjustment of medication regimens during Ramadan. Content analysis was used to analyze pharmacists’ answers to the question concerning what they would like the workshop to cover. Main outcome measure Pharmacists’ aggregate scores for all three diabetes management knowledge questions and pharmacists’ willingness to attend a workshop on the adjustment of medication regimens during Ramadan.

The novel direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors are less well described and do not have existing antidotes.This article reviews the relevant literature on traumatic outcomes with use of ACAP medications, as well as data on ideal reversal strategies. Suggested algorithms are introduced, and future research directions discussed.Although they are beneficial in preventing clot formation, once bleeding occurs ACAP medications contribute to increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in geriatric patient populations. The efficacy of clopidogrel reversal with platelet transfusions and DDAVP remains unclear. Warfarin use is best treated with the algorithm-driven use of plasma, vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) and possibly recombinant factor VIIa depending upon specific patient and injury factors. Optimal treatment for direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors has yet to be developed, but PCCs are promising for rivaroxaban and apixaban while dabigatran is best treated with medication cessation and the possible addition of activated PCCs or hemodialysis.New developments in reversal of the ACAP medications are promising, particularly PCCs for warfarin and the factor Xa inhibitors.

Under-treatment with oral anticoagulants has been a significant challenge of treatment, historically related to patient concerns over the safety and convenience of warfarin, which until recently was the only oral anticoagulant available.The aim of this study is to examine: (1) patient preferences for attributes of warfarin and the new oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) in AF; (2) which attributes are most important; and (3) whether current under-treatment is likely to improve with the new oral anticoagulants.This study was conducted in Melbourne, Australia, with members of the general public with or without AF aged ≥40&nbsp;years, where those without AF proxy for newly-diagnosed patients. Participants completed a computerised best–best discrete choice experiment (and follow-up interview) as if they had AF with a moderate-to-high risk of stroke. Choice data were modelled using mixed rank-ordered logit. Relative value was explored via estimation of marginal rates of substitution with predicted probability analysis used to simulate potential uptake of oral anticoagulants.Seventy-six participants were recruited and completed the study. Efficacy (stroke risk) was more important than safety (bleed risk, antidote), which were both considerably more important than convenience factors (blood tests, dose frequency, drug or food interactions). Cost was also important. Predicted use of the new oral anticoagulants (and under-treatment of AF) using simulation, given moderate-to-high risk of stroke, is 25&nbsp;% (52&nbsp;%), 54&nbsp;% (29&nbsp;%) and 70&nbsp;% (21&nbsp;%) assuming a market price of AUD$120/month, AUD$30/month (subsidised price) and AUD$30/month with an antidote, respectively.Based on the study sample and the modelled attributes, the overall profiles of the new oral anticoagulants were preferred to warfarin as their cost decreased. Public subsidisation and the development of antidotes (such as vitamin K for warfarin) for the new oral anticoagulants may have a positive effect on the under-treatment of AF.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:16.851Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:16.851Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772b84d83dcf45b364efb","title":"Categorization of allergic disorders in the new World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2045-7022-4-42","abstract":"Although efforts to improve the classification of hypersensitivity/allergic diseases have been made, they have not been considered a top-level category in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 and still are not in the ICD-11 beta phase linearization.

Median (range) dose normalized cyclosporin AUC and C2 were 1.15&nbsp;(mg*h/L)/mg/kg (0.72–3.0) and 265.5&nbsp;(ng/ml)/mg/kg (120.8–725.7), respectively, on the innovator therapy and 1.05&nbsp;(mg*h/L)/mg/kg (0.54–2.22) and 317.1&nbsp;(ng/ml)/mg/kg (116.7–564.7) for the generic drug after the switch. The median (range) percentage of change in the AUC and C2 when switching between formulations were 16.7&nbsp;% (0.7–56.7) and 13.1&nbsp;% (3.7–68.6), respectively. No significant changes in serum creatinine levels were registered when comparing before and after substitution of products. Adverse events (number of events) recorded 5&nbsp;months before and after the switch included hirsutism (2), hypertension (2), and gingival hyperplasia (1). Conclusion Conversion of cyclosporin from innovator brand to generic in pediatric renal transplant patients needs to be closely monitored.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:20.868Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:20.868Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772bc4d83dcf45b364f02","title":"Anticoagulation for Noncardiac Indications in Neurologic Patients: Comparative Use of Non-Vitamin K Oral Anticoagulants, Low-Molecular-Weight Heparins, and Warfarin","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11940-014-0309-2","abstract":"Patients with neurologic disorders may develop a wide variety of thromboembolic events, both as a primary manifestation and as a consequence of their underlying neurologic condition. There are many available options for anticoagulation, ranging from warfarin to the parenteral subcutaneously administered anticoagulants to the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Warfarin is orally available, well-studied, and easily reversible in the setting of bleeding, but has a prolonged onset of action, measured in days, and equally slow offset; requires frequent monitoring for dose titration; and has multiple drug-drug and food-drug interactions. Parenteral heparin-based anticoagulants are well-studied and have more predictable pharmacokinetics but are often more expensive, only partially reversible, and require daily injections, which can be difficult for patients to tolerate over long periods of time. The NOACs are easy to administer and have predictable pharmacokinetics but are expensive, not easily reversible, and are not as extensively studied. Specific agents are preferable in some defined neurologic conditions. For acute ischemic stroke, we do not recommend immediate anticoagulation with any agent. For patients with intracranial malignancy (either primary or metastatic), we recommend a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) rather than warfarin or a NOAC. For thromboembolic disease in the setting of spinal cord injury, warfarin, LMWH, or the NOACs are reasonable options. In the setting of VTE or stroke related to antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), we recommend long-term warfarin anticoagulation with an INR goal of 2–3, pending the results of ongoing research involving the NOACs. For cerebral venous sinus thrombosis not related to malignancy or APS, we recommend the use of LMWH in the acute setting, followed by at least three months of warfarin. In this article, we discuss the pharmacology, pathophysiology, and comparative research that served as a basis for our recommendations.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:20.868Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:20.868Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772bc4d83dcf45b364f03","title":"XALIA: rationale and design of a non-interventional study of rivaroxaban compared with standard therapy for initial and long-term anticoagulation in deep vein thrombosis","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1477-9560-12-16","abstract":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, poses a substantial clinical risk, and the incidence of these thrombotic-related diseases remains high. Anticoagulation aims to prevent thrombus extension and reduce the risk of recurrent events, particularly fatal pulmonary embolism. In EINSTEIN DVT, rivaroxaban was non-inferior to enoxaparin/vitamin K antagonists for the reduction of recurrent VTE, with a similar safety profile and a net clinical benefit. EINSTEIN EXT investigated patients receiving long-term treatment in whom there was no clear decision about continuing or stopping anticoagulation; rivaroxaban was superior to placebo in the reduction of recurrent VTE, showing an acceptable benefit–risk balance. Rivaroxaban has the potential to replace standard therapy, usually parenteral low molecular weight heparin overlapping with and followed by a vitamin K antagonist, for the treatment of acute symptomatic DVT and the secondary prevention of VTE. As the use of rivaroxaban for DVT treatment increases in clinical practice, a fundamental understanding of its clinical benefits in everyday patient care is essential. XALIA (XArelto for Long-term and Initial Anticoagulation in venous thromboembolism) is a multicentre, prospective, non-interventional, observational study investigating the effectiveness and safety of a single-drug approach with rivaroxaban compared with standard therapy in patients with DVT. The study cohort will include approximately 4800 patients (≥18&nbsp;years old) with objectively confirmed acute DVT who will be treated for a period of ≥3&nbsp;months. The primary outcomes will be the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (primarily major bleeding), symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolic events and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes include: major cardiovascular events; patient-reported treatment satisfaction and adherence; healthcare resource utilization; reasons for drug switching or interruption of treatment; and adverse events. XALIA will follow an international cohort of patients in more than 20 European countries, and others including Israel and Canada. The first patient was enrolled in June 2012, with results expected in 2015. It is anticipated that XALIA will provide important information on the treatment of DVT in a heterogeneous, unselected patient population in a real-world setting and provide important supplementary information to that obtained from the EINSTEIN DVT phase III study.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:20.869Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:20.869Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772bc4d83dcf45b364f04","title":"Concurrent Use of Drugs and Supplements in a Community-Dwelling Population Aged 50&nbsp;Years or More: Potential Benefits and Risks","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40266-014-0180-6","abstract":"The use of vitamin and mineral (VMs) and non-vitamin/non-mineral supplements (non-VMs) in the general population and the older population in developed countries has increased.

Preclinical studies showed it acts as a pharmacologically active pro-drug with two key active metabolites: sulfoxide and sulfone (the most active metabolite). The present studies aimed to determine the best dose regimen for the treatment of stage&nbsp;2 sleeping sickness patients, which could eventually also treat stage&nbsp;1 patients.Fexinidazole was assessed in 154 healthy adult male subjects of sub-Saharan African origin. Three initial first-in-human studies and two additional studies assessed a single ascending dose and multiple ascending doses (both under fasted conditions), tablet versus suspension formulation and food effect (fasted vs. high-fat meal and field-adapted food), and multiple ascending doses with a loading dose regimen under fed conditions.Fexinidazole was well-tolerated in a single dose from 100 to 3,600&nbsp;mg, with quick absorption of the parent drug and rapid metabolism into sulfoxide [time to maximum concentration (t max) 2–5&nbsp;h] and sulfone (t max 18–24&nbsp;h). The tablet formulation was approximately 25&nbsp;% less bioavailable than the suspension, and food intake increased drug absorption and plasma concentrations of fexinidazole and its two metabolites by approximately 200&nbsp;%. Fourteen-day multiple ascending dosing administered up to 3,600&nbsp;mg/day in fasted conditions showed that fexinidazole was generally well-tolerated (mild to moderate, spontaneously reversible drug-related adverse events). Following the high-fat food effect finding, another study was conducted to evaluate the impact of a low-fat regimen closer to that of the target population, showing that the type of meal does not influence fexinidazole absorption. The last study showed that a loading dose of 1,800&nbsp;mg/day for 4&nbsp;days followed by a 1,200&nbsp;mg/day regimen for 6&nbsp;days with a normal meal provided the desired exposure of fexinidazole and its metabolites, particularly sulfone, with good tolerability. Based on preclinical evidence from a chronic infection mouse model, systemic drug concentrations obtained are expected to be clinically effective in stage&nbsp;2 HAT.These studies show that fexinidazole can be safely assessed in patients as a potential oral cure for both stages of HAT.","year":"2014","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:20.869Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:20.869Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772bc4d83dcf45b364f09","title":"Status and thoughts of Chinese patent medicines seeking approval in the US market","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11655-014-1936-0","abstract":"Veregen™ and Fulyzaq are the first two botanical drug products that were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market in the US in recent years.

Appropriate amendment of drug regimens, careful monitoring of symptoms, as well as providing patients with available evidence on fasting and MS are important parts of management. Evidence from experimental studies suggests that calorie restriction before disease induction reduces inflammation and subsequent demyelination and attenuates disease severity.

Several recent studies have demonstrated that poor adherence to imatinib may hamper the therapeutic outcomes and result in increased medical expenditures, whilst research on exploring the reasons for non-adherence to imatinib is still limited. Objective This study aimed to explore the experience of patients as they journey through their CML treatments and associated imatinib utilisation in order to understand the perceptions, attitudes and concerns that may influence adherence to imatinib treatment. Setting This study was conducted at oncology outpatient clinics in a medical centre in southern Taiwan. Methods CML patients who regularly attended the oncology outpatient clinics to receive imatinib treatment from October 2011 to March 2012 were invited to participate in the study. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were used to explore patients’ experiences and views of their treatment, their current CML status and CML-related health conditions, their concerns about imatinib treatment and imatinib-taking behaviours. Patient interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using the constant comparison approach. Main outcome measure Themes related to patients’ views of the disease and health conditions, worries and concerns influencing imatinib utilisation behaviours are reported. Results Forty-two CML patients participated in the interviews. The emerging themes included: acceptance of current disease and health status, misconceptions about disease progression, factors associated with adherence to imatinib, concerns and management of adverse drug effects. Participants regarded CML as a chronic disease but had misconceptions about disease progression, therapeutic monitoring, resistance to imatinib and symptoms of side effects. Participants were generally adherent to imatinib and favoured long-term prescriptions to avoid regular outpatient visits for medication refills. Experiencing adverse effect was the main reason influencing adherence and led to polypharmacy. Most participants altered medicine-taking behaviours to maintain long-term use of imatinib. Conclusion Taiwanese CML patients are adherent to imatinib but report changing their medication-taking behaviour due to adverse drug effects and associated polypharmacy. Patients’ misconceptions of the disease and medication suggests that it is necessary to improve communication between patients and healthcare professionals. Routinely providing updated information as part of the patient counselling process should be considered as a means of improving this communication.","year":"2013","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:31.975Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:31.975Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772cc4d83dcf45b364f15","title":"Apixaban, Dabigatran, and Rivaroxaban Versus Warfarin for Stroke Prevention in Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40261-013-0144-3","abstract":"Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) increases the risk of systemic thromboembolic events; therefore, anticoagulant treatment with vitamin K antagonists is widely prescribed.

This result was sensitive to the time in (warfarin) therapeutic range and time horizon.Our analysis suggests that NOAs are a cost-effective treatment for the prevention of stroke in patients with NVAF in the Italian healthcare setting.","year":"2013","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:36.702Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:36.702Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772d24d83dcf45b364f22","title":"Practical management of patients on apixaban: a consensus guide","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1477-9560-11-27","abstract":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common tachyarrhythmia in Australia, with a prevalence over 10% in older patients. AF is the leading preventable cause of ischaemic stroke, and strokes due to AF have a higher mortality and morbidity. Stroke prevention is therefore a key management strategy for AF patients, in addition to rate and rhythm control. Anticoagulation with warfarin has been an enduring gold standard for stroke prevention in NVAF patients. In Australia, three novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban are now approved and reimbursed for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF (NVAF). International European Cardiology guidelines now recommend either a NOAC or warfarin for NVAF patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2, unless contraindicated. Apixaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor with a 12-hour half-life and 25% renal excretion that was found in a large trial of NVAF patients to be superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism. In this trial population, apixaban also resulted in less bleeding and a lower mortality rate than warfarin.Clinical experience with apixaban outside of clinical trials has been limited, and there is currently little evidence to guide the management of bleeding or invasive procedures in patients taking apixaban. The relevant currently available animal and ex vivo human data were collected, analyzed and summarized.This multi-disciplinary consensus statement has been written to serve as a guide for healthcare practitioners prescribing apixaban in Australia, with a focus on acute and emergency management.The predictable pharmacokinetics and minimal drug interactions of apixaban should allow for safe anticoagulation in the majority of patients, including temporary interruption for elective procedures. In the absence of published data, patients actively bleeding on apixaban should receive standard supportive treatment. Quantitative assays of apixaban level such as chromogenic anti-Xa assays are becoming available but their utility is unproven in this setting. Specific antidotes for novel anticoagulants, including apixaban, are in clinical development.","year":"2013","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:42.564Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:42.564Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772d24d83dcf45b364f23","title":"Drug-related problems in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with dyslipidemia","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-13-1192","abstract":"Drug-Related Problems (DRPs) commonly occur among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.

Elderly AF patients are undertreated with vitamin K antagonists (VKA). The new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban have been shown to be non-inferior to VKA for stroke prevention in AF. We summarize the knowledge about primary and secondary stroke prevention by NOAC in AF patients >75&nbsp;years of age. A literature search was carried out using the terms ‘dabigatran’, ‘rivaroxaban’, ‘apixaban’, ‘elderly’, ‘octogenarians’, ‘atrial fibrillation’ and ‘anticoagulation’ from 1998 to 2013. Randomized clinical trials, longitudinal studies, case series and case reports were included. Whereas studies investigating the use of VKA for stroke prevention in the 1990s were carried out by industry-independent institutions, all NOAC-investigating trials were sponsored by the manufacturers of the respective drugs. Frail elderly people were not represented in NOAC-investigating trials because of various exclusion criteria, and only one-third of patients were aged >75&nbsp;years. A subgroup analysis from the dabigatran-investigating trial indicated that elderly patients might have a higher risk for extracranial bleeding complications with NOAC than with VKA. Further concerns about the use of NOAC in the elderly are the high prevalence of renal insufficiency in AF patients >75&nbsp;years of age, the largely unknown risk of drug–drug and drug–food interactions, the lack of easily available laboratory monitoring tests of anticoagulant activity and the lack of an antidote. There is a need for independent studies comparing the efficacy and risk of side effects of NOAC with that of VKA in elderly AF patients.","year":"2013","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:42.564Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:42.564Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772d54d83dcf45b364f28","title":"The heart of medical care","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12682-013-0156-z","abstract":"Why have I decided to be a medical doctor?

Objective This research sought to describe levels of self-reported participant confidence in anticoagulation management; development, implementation, and performance management of both core and supplemental activities of anticoagulation clinics or services; and current anticoagulation clinical practices subsequent to participating in the Anticoagulation Training Program. Setting A federal Indian Health Service healthcare facility in Oklahoma, USA. Methods A cross-sectional, electronic mail survey was designed, pretested, and administered to 267 eligible Anticoagulation Training Program participants from 1999 to 2009. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and interpreted to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. Main outcome measures Information about confidence in anticoagulation management skills; development, implementation and improvement of both core and supplemental activities of anticoagulation clinics or services; and current anticoagulation clinical practices was collected. Results After training, over 90&nbsp;% of participants reported agreement/strong agreement with statements about confidence in performing patient-care related anticoagulation activities. A smaller proportion (83.3–85.4&nbsp;%) reported agreement/strong agreement with confidence in measuring, analyzing and reporting anticoagulation outcomes. Improvement activities were more common than development or implementation activities (65.4, 31.9 and 35.1&nbsp;%, respectively). Not having well established reimbursement procedures, lack of dedicated clinic space, and lack of dedicated personnel salaries (47.3, 38.3 and 32.6&nbsp;%, respectively) were reported as the most common barriers to developing, implementing or improving an anticoagulation clinic. Participants indicated that anticoagulation outcomes tracking was the most common supplemental development, implementation and improvement activity (37.9, 37.0 and 43.8&nbsp;% respectively).

In this study we compare two different methods of seed selection to determine whether this may influence recruitment and RDS measures.Two seed groups were established. One group was selected as per a standard RDS approach of study staff purposefully selecting a small number of individuals to initiate recruitment chains. The second group consisted of individuals self-presenting to study staff during the time of data collection. Recruitment was allowed to unfold from each group and RDS estimates were compared between the groups. A comparison of variables associated with HIV was also completed.Three analytic groups were used for the majority of the analyses–RDS recruits originating from study staff-selected seeds (n = 196); self-presenting seeds (n = 118); and recruits of self-presenting seeds (n = 264). Multinomial logistic regression demonstrated significant differences between the three groups across six of ten sociodemographic and risk behaviours examined. Examination of homophily values also revealed differences in recruitment from the two seed groups (e.g. in one arm of the study sex workers and solvent users tended not to recruit others like themselves, while the opposite was true in the second arm of the study). RDS estimates of population proportions were also different between the two recruitment arms; in some cases corresponding confidence intervals between the two recruitment arms did not overlap. Further differences were revealed when comparisons of HIV prevalence were carried out.RDS is a cost-effective tool for data collection, however, seed selection has the potential to influence which subgroups within a population are accessed. Our findings indicate that using multiple methods for seed selection may improve access to hidden populations. Our results further highlight the need for a greater understanding of RDS to ensure appropriate, accurate and representative estimates of a population can be obtained from an RDS sample.","year":"2013","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:52.104Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:52.104Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772dc4d83dcf45b364f33","title":"Risk versus Benefit of Non-Vitamin K Dependent Anticoagulants Compared to Warfarin for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation in the Elderly","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40266-013-0075-y","abstract":"The objective of this review was to compare the safety and efficacy of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban to warfarin for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in older adults. The prevalence and incidence of AF increase with age. Approximately 5&nbsp;% of the United States population over the age of sixty-five years and 10&nbsp;% over the age of seventy-nine years have AF. AF is associated with increased risk for thromboembolic events. Despite the increasing incidence and prevalence of AF in older adults and the risks of thromboembolic events, clinicians often avoid anticoagulants. Specifically with warfarin, the risk of hemorrhage may outweigh the benefit in stroke risk reduction in certain populations. Aspirin, while safer to use, is not as effective as warfarin in stroke risk reduction. Newer non-vitamin K dependent antithrombotic therapies (e.g. dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) are redefining thromboprophylaxis of AF. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are at least as effective as warfarin in stroke risk reduction. With new mechanisms of action and no need for therapeutic drug monitoring, countless new patients are potential candidates for anticoagulation. However patient adherence, lack of a reversal agent, cost, and other safety concerns remain reasons for caution and careful consideration. Furthermore, older adults exhibited greater adverse effects from these agents across the clinical trials. This review will examine the newer anticoagulants safety and efficacy with particular attention to their role in treating older adults with AF. Alternatives to warfarin therapy now exist for thromboprophylaxis of AF. Whether these agents represent advances in overall safety in older adults remains uncertain. More experience and research are needed before endorsing their widespread use as a replacement for warfarin in the geriatric population.","year":"2013","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:52.104Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:52.104Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772dc4d83dcf45b364f34","title":"Efficacy and Safety of New Oral Anticoagulants for Extended Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism: Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of Randomized Controlled Trials","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40265-013-0082-7","abstract":"Currently available anticoagulants have limitations for long term treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE).A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for extended treatment of VTE.PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science and CINAHL databases were searched from January 01, 2001 through February 28, 2013.

This is especially of concern if the bleeding is related to the use of a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) such as dabigatran or rivaroxaban, given the dearth of literature addressing the reversal of their anticoagulant effects. The goal of treatment is to prevent progression to catastrophic hemorrhage or exsanguination, and decrease bleeding-related morbidity and mortality. Clinical decisions in such instances should be made in a timely fashion to address the necessity for intervention. Animal models have shown potential for the use of 'fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) in reversing bleeding related to novel oral anticoagulants. However, there is paucity of clinical trials assessing the efficacy of these agents in humans in such clinical scenarios. Hence, there are no guidelines or ideal agents to use in such a scenario. We do not recommend the use of FFP for bleeding related to NOACs. In the setting of early overdose of dabigatran (within 3–4&nbsp;hours), activated charcoal may be given, and hemodialysis may be used if there is evidence of critical organ bleeding. In our opinion, 4-factor PCC or 3-factor PCC at a dose of about 50&nbsp;U/kg may be given in an emergency setting to manage bleeding related to factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban or apixaban, but not direct thrombin inhibitors such as dabigatran. We are also of the opinion that aPCC (FEIBA®) would not be helpful for management of direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran)-related bleeding, based on current available efficacy data in humans. We reserve the use of Novoseven® as a last resort, given the lack of pre-clinical or clinical data supporting its ability to reverse the anticoagulant effects of NOACs, except in one case report where it was used in combination with hemodialysis.","year":"2013","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:52.104Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:52.104Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772df4d83dcf45b364f38","title":"Histone methylation and acetylation indicates epigenetic change in the aged cochlea of mice","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00405-012-2222-1","abstract":"It is currently accepted that epigenetics plays an important role in normal genetics and differentiation, and its failure triggers various diseases such as cancer, aging, metabolic diseases, and abnormal differentiations.

The degeneration was severest in the spiral ganglion cells and the organ of Corti of the basal turn as determined by light microscopy. Acetylated histone H3 was detected in the spiral ganglion cells and the organ of Corti of the young group, but not in those of the aged group. Dimethylated histone H3 was detected in the spiral ganglion cells and the organ of Corti of the aged group, but not in those of the young group. Acetylation was switched to methylation during ageing.

Some of these will only be detected in the postmarketing setting. Effective screening in large collections of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) requires automated triages to identify signals of adverse drug interactions. Research so far has focused on statistical measures, but clinical information and pharmacological characteristics are essential in the clinical assessment and may be of great value in first-pass filtering of potential adverse drug interaction signals.The aim of this study was to develop triages for adverse drug interaction surveillance, and to evaluate these prospectively relative to clinical assessment.A broad set of variables were considered for inclusion in the triages, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity, explicit suspicions of drug interactions as noted by the reporter, dose and treatment overlap, and a measure of interaction disproportionality. Their unique contributions in predicting signals of adverse drug interactions were determined through logistic regression. This was based on the reporting in the WHO global ICSR database, VigiBase™, for a set of known adverse drug interactions and corresponding negative controls. Three triages were developed, each producing an estimated probability that a given drug–drug–ADR triplet constitutes an adverse drug interaction signal. The triages were evaluated against two separate benchmarks derived from expert clinical assessment: adverse drug interactions known in the literature and prospective adverse drug interaction signals. For reference, the triages were compared with disproportionality analysis alone using the same benchmarks.The following were identified as valuable predictors of adverse drug interaction signals: plausible CYP metabolism; notes of suspected interaction by the reporter; and reports of unexpected therapeutic response, altered therapeutic effect with dose information and altered therapeutic effect when only two drugs had been used. The new triages identified reporting patterns corresponding to both prospective signals of adverse drug interactions and already established ones. They perform better than disproportionality analysis alone relative to both benchmarks.A range of predictors for adverse drug interaction signals have been identified. They substantially improve signal detection capacity compared with disproportionality analysis alone. The value of incorporating clinical and pharmacological information in first-pass screening is clear.","year":"2013","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:55.521Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:55.521Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772df4d83dcf45b364f3c","title":"Management of Pulmonary Embolism: State of the Art Treatment and Emerging Research","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11936-013-0229-6","abstract":"Pulmonary embolism is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular medicine and demands a circumscribed algorithmic treatment approach (Fig.&nbsp;1). Anticoagulation should be triggered by a high clinical probability and continued based on urgent definitive imaging. Our assessment then continues with evaluation of the clinical severity of the pulmonary embolism to determine whether the patient will benefit from thrombolysis or not. We usually reserve this option for cases of massive pulmonary embolism (sustained hypotension, pulselessness, or persistent profound bradycardia) or patients with a low cardiopulmonary reserve and categorical signs of right ventricle failure. At this juncture, renal function, a diagnosis of active cancer, calculated bleeding risk, and estimated patient compliance will help us gravitate toward specific agent selection for subsequent anticoagulation management. While rivaroxaban is an attractive oral therapy option, it is not an appropriate choice for patients with significant renal disease; patients with cancer are better treated with low molecular weight heparin when possible. Warfarin anticoagulation continues to be a well-known, valid, and cost-effective treatment option. At the end of the primary treatment we assess each patient for the likelihood of thromboembolism recurrence, which will be highest among those patients with idiopathic events or those with cancer-associated thrombosis. We favor prolonged anticoagulation in these scenarios. In addition, we strongly advocate periodic scheduled follow up of patients on long-term anticoagulation for secondary prophylaxis to re-evaluate their bleeding and recurrence risk. We understand both of these extremes are in a dynamic balance, and likewise so should be the anticoagulation directives. As we learn more about recurrence and bleeding prediction, we foresee a personalized approach in which the anticoagulant agent for each patient will be narrowly chosen based on their specific performance.","year":"2013","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:55.521Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:18:55.521Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772df4d83dcf45b364f3d","title":"Treatment of posthepatitic cirrhosis by Fuzheng Huayu Tablet (扶正化瘀片) for reinforcing qi and resolving stasis","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11655-013-1433-7","abstract":"To investigate the efficacy and safety of the Fuzheng Huayu Tablet (扶正化瘀片, FZHYT), which is used to reinforce qi and resolve stasis in patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis (PHC).A multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted in 180 patients with PHC.

A theory–practice gap was found in this study that may be related to the authority of physicians not nurses in ordering rules for medication administration through enteral catheters.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:11.265Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:11.265Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772ef4d83dcf45b364f54","title":"Chloramine-induced anaphylaxis while showering: a case report","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1752-1947-6-324","abstract":"Sodium-N-chlorine-p-toluene sulfonamide, commonly known as chloramine-T, is a derivative of chlorine which is widely used as a disinfectant. For many years, chloramine-T has been described as a cause of immediate-type hypersensitivity, especially with regard to asthma and rhinitis, and as a cause of occupational dermatoses in cleaning personnel in hospitals, although no anaphylactic reaction has yet been reported. Hence, to the best of our knowledge we present the first case of anaphylaxis to chloramine-T with evidence of specific immunoglobulin E antibodies.We describe the case of a 25-year-old Caucasian woman who was in good health and with a negative history for atopy, including no respiratory symptoms of rhinitis or asthma, and with no professional exposure to chloramine-T. She, while showering, applied a chloramine-T solution to a skin area with folliculitis on her leg, and within a few minutes developed generalized urticaria and angioedema, followed by vomiting and collapse with loss of consciousness. A skin prick test with a chloramine-T solution at 10mg/mL concentration was positive, and specific immunoglobulin E to chloramine-T was quantified at a value of 2.9 optical density as measured by the enzyme allergosorbent test technique.The strict cause-effect relationship and the results of the skin test and the in vitro test make certain the causative role of chloramine-T in this case of anaphylaxis. This suggests that chloramine-T, based on its wide use as a disinfectant, should be considered a possible cause in anaphylaxis of unknown origin.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:11.265Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:11.265Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772ef4d83dcf45b364f56","title":"Balancing Efficacy and Bleeding Risk in the Prevention of Stroke Due to Atrial Fibrillation with Newer Oral Anticoagulants","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12288-012-0167-6","abstract":"With the evaluation and approval of newer oral anticoagulants such as the factor IIa inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate and the factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, strategies for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation need a thorough re-evaluation of current options. Clinicians are naturally excited about the imminent introduction of these newer drugs that do not need international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring, besides having no drug–food and minimal drug–drug interactions. However, as with all new drugs, it is always prudent to use these judiciously so that they stay in our therapeutic armamentarium for a long time. More than 56&nbsp;years after the introduction of warfarin we now have three drugs, viz., dabigatran 150&nbsp;mg bid, rivaroxaban 20&nbsp;mg od, and apixaban 5&nbsp;mg bid which were effective in comparison with warfarin in reducing the risk of stroke and bleeding in the landmark trials, RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, and ARISTOTLE respectively. There is a thin dividing line between physiological hemostasis and pathological thrombosis. Routine INR monitoring may not be required but in special situations, such as prior to major surgery, overdose, non-compliance or stroke while on the anticoagulant, one may wish to know whether there are any laboratory measures of efficacy or means of reversal of over anticoagulation. Similar questions may be raised about other situations such as renal dysfunction, cardioversion, ablation procedures, post-stenting, or switch to and from warfarin, heparin or LMWH? This document is an attempt to address these concerns based on available evidence and give physicians a perspective and practice guidelines on how best to use these agents, both old and new, for optimal patient outcomes, maximizing efficacy and minimizing risk.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:11.266Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:11.266Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772ef4d83dcf45b364f59","title":"New Oral Anticoagulants","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/11635730-000000000-00000","abstract":"Oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) is widely used to prevent and treat thromboembolic events. Traditionally, warfarin has been the drug of choice and, indeed, this drug is effective and provides a more than 60% reduction in stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, OAT entails an increased bleeding risk, and management of this is challenging. Among other things, new oral anticoagulant drugs offer fixed dosing, more predictable pharmacokinetics and fewer interactions with drugs and food. Moreover, these drugs seem to provide an improved benefit-risk ratio with respect to thromboembolic events and bleeding complications in a broad patient population. The new drugs differ from traditional OAT with respect to their mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics, especially with respect to elimination through the kidneys. These drugs may potentially cause bleeding complications in patients with reduced drug excretion due to impaired renal function. Dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban carry the highest risk due to a high degree of renal excretion, whereas the risk for apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban seems lower. Pharmacokinetic studies and data from clinical studies have provided information on how to guide dosing in patients with renal impairment. However, the risk of drug accumulation and bleeding may be amplified by several drug-drug interactions. This article provides a review of the literature on the pharmacology of new anticoagulant drugs with particular focus on the impact of impaired renal function.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:11.266Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:11.266Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6772f24d83dcf45b364f5e","title":"Using Growth Mixture Modeling to Identify Heterosexual Men Who Reduce Their Frequency of Unprotected Sex Following a Behavioral Intervention","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-012-0187-0","abstract":"Using growth mixture modeling, two 12-month trajectories of unprotected sex were identified in 210 heterosexual men (76&nbsp;% African American, M age&nbsp;=&nbsp;33.2&nbsp;years) attending a sexual risk reduction intervention.

Weighted estimates were calculated for HIV-related risk behaviours, HIV testing and self-reported HIV, including subgroup estimates for gender spectrum and ethno-racial groups.Trans people in Ontario report a wide range of sexual behaviours with a full range of partner types. High proportions – 25% of female-to-male (FTM) and 51% of MTF individuals – had not had a sex partner within the past year. Of MTFs, 19% had a past-year high-risk sexual experience, versus 7% of FTMs. The largest behavioural contributors to HIV risk were sexual behaviours some may assume trans people do not engage in: unprotected receptive genital sex for FTMs and insertive genital sex for MTFs. Overall, 46% had never been tested for HIV; lifetime testing was highest in Aboriginal trans people and lowest among non-Aboriginal racialized people. Approximately 15% of both FTM and MTF participants had engaged in sex work or exchange sex and about 2% currently work in the sex trade. Self-report of HIV prevalence was 10 times the estimated baseline prevalence for Ontario. However, given wide confidence intervals and the high proportion of trans people who had never been tested for HIV, estimating the actual prevalence was not possible.Results suggest potentially higher than baseline levels of HIV; however low testing rates were observed and self-reported prevalences likely underestimate seroprevalence. Explicit inclusion of trans people in epidemiological surveillance statistics would provide much-needed information on incidence and prevalence.

However, multicomponent preparations are gaining increasing importance in the phytopharmaceutical field by demonstrating beneficial properties with respect to efficacy and toxicity.In contrast to single drug combinations, a botanical multicomponent therapeutic possesses a complex repertoire of chemicals that belong to a variety of substance classes. This may explain the frequently observed pleiotropic bioactivity spectra of these compounds, which may also suggest that they possess novel therapeutic opportunities. Interestingly, considerable bioactivity properties are exhibited not only by remedies that contain high doses of phytochemicals with prominent pharmaceutical efficacy, but also preparations that lack a sole active principle component. Despite that each individual substance within these multicomponents has a low molar fraction, the therapeutic activity of these substances is established via a potentialization of their effects through combined and simultaneous attacks on multiple molecular targets. Although beneficial properties may emerge from such a broad range of perturbations on cellular machinery, validation and/or prediction of their activity profiles is accompanied with a variety of difficulties in generic risk-benefit assessments. Thus, it is recommended that a comprehensive strategy is implemented to cover the entirety of multicomponent-multitarget effects, so as to address the limitations of conventional approaches.An integration of standard toxicological methods with selected pathway-focused bioassays and unbiased data acquisition strategies (such as gene expression analysis) would be advantageous in building an interaction network model to consider all of the effects, whether they were intended or adverse reactions.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:28.346Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:28.346Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773004d83dcf45b364f72","title":"PEGylation of Interferon-β-1a","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/11596970-000000000-00000","abstract":"Achieving optimal patient benefit from biological therapies can be hindered by drug instability, rapid clearance requiring frequent dosing or potential immune reactions.

Rates of major bleeding were 4.4 vs 4.5 events per 100 person-years for the PMWT and UC groups, respectively. Pharmacists performed 284 interventions with an acceptance rate of 80.3% from physicians. Conclusion Pharmacist-managed warfarin therapy resulted in a significantly better anticoagulation control. This study showed that a collaborative approach in anticoagulation management can be successfully implemented in a developing country. Implementation of such care model in other developing countries should be considered.","year":"2011","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:35.415Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:35.415Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773074d83dcf45b364f78","title":"Potential benefits of warfarin monitoring by a clinical pharmacist in a long term care facility","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11239-011-0642-1","abstract":"The primary objective of this study was to determine whether warfarin therapy monitoring by a pharmacist would benefit a long-term care facility, by maintaining patients within therapeutic INR range more consistently than the current practice of physician monitoring.Secondary objectives included whether adverse events resulting from non-therapeutic INR levels differed significantly between groups and whether pharmacist interventions resulted in decreased overall costs to the facility.

A retrospective chart review of 320 patients having 546 isolated subtherapeutic INR episodes included patients with an INR below their therapeutic range, preceded by two INRs within or above range. Bridged episodes required more frequent follow-up visits to achieve therapeutic INR (2.5&nbsp;±&nbsp;1.0 vs. 2.2&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.6; P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.097), but fewer days until the INR returned to therapeutic range (6.8&nbsp;±&nbsp;5.0 vs. 18.9&nbsp;±&nbsp;16.0; P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.0001). The strongest predictor of bridging was the magnitude the INR fell below the therapeutic range, where those with a severely-low INR were 30-fold more likely to be bridged (P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.0001), and moderately-low INR episodes were 6-fold more likely to be bridged compared with mildly-low INR (P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.0001). Those at high thromboembolic risk were more likely to be bridged than at low-risk (OR 3.39 [1.50–7.68]; P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0034).

Incremental cost difference of bridging was significantly greater for total cost ($967.13) and its components, direct medical ($951.32), transportation ($2.73) and productivity cost ($13.08).

Renal function is known to decline with aging. However, as a result of reduced muscle mass, older individuals frequently have a depressed glomerular filtration rate (GFR) despite normal serum creatinine, and such a concealed renal insufficiency may impact significantly on the clearance of hydrosoluble drugs, as well as the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from hydrosoluble drugs. The assessment of renal function should thus be a mandatory item in the global examination of patient characteristics. Equations for estimatingGFR have become very popular in recent years. However, different equations may yield significantly different estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values, which have important implications in dosing drugs cleared by the kidney. Current knowledge suggests that eGFR based on the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiological Collaboration (CKD-EPI) study equation outperformed eGFR based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation and creatinine clearance estimate based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula as a predictor of ADRs from kidney cleared drugs. More recently, the combined creatinine-cystatin C equation was shown to perform better than equations based on either of these markers alone in diagnosing CKD, even in older patients. However, its accuracy in predicting ADRs and usefulness in drug dosing is still to be investigated.","year":"2013","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:35.415Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:35.415Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67730c4d83dcf45b364f7f","title":"Food Synergy: The Key to Balancing the Nutrition Research Effort","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03391648","abstract":"Mediterranean-type diet patterns are consistently associated with reduced risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer in the general population. In contrast, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on nutrient supplements have shown no or adverse long-term effects on long-term chronic disease. Food in its natural form is a nonrandom mixture of numerous molecules, orchestrated evolutionarily to maintain the life of the organism being eaten. Food synergy assumes that the biologically determined combination of nutrients and other bioactive substances found in food plays a concerted role in influencing health. Coupled with reduced risk in the Mediterranean-type diet pattern, food synergy implies that the concerted action of nutrients and other bioactive substances in fruit, vegetables, whole grain cereals, nuts, and legumes is beneficial for health. The assumption that single molecules work in isolation as they work in food violates the food synergy concept of concerted action and often leads to a partial picture. Public health nutrition strategies that focus on single nutrients have led to a flourishing diet supplement industry and advice to the public to eat low-fat diets. The latter is questionable in two respects: not all fats are equal, and industry efforts to comply spun-off products high in refined carbohydrates. It is time to rethink the research paradigm concerning diet and health. Reductionist research, though valuable, focuses on partial pathways, rather than the whole system integrating a lifetime of food intake with the long-term health of intact humans. Epidemiology provides this information, but is subject to residual confounding. RCTs are useful, but RCTs of food differ fundamentally from RCTs of drugs; for example, in terms of blinding, long-term adherence, and specificity of the reference treatment. All research inferences are most secure when based on convergent evidence from multiple research approaches. A balanced approach is therefore needed in nutrition research.","year":"2011","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:40.244Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:40.244Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67730c4d83dcf45b364f80","title":"(Un)Awareness of Allergy","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1097/WOX.0b013e31823842bc","abstract":"Allergy is associated with considerable morbidity.The aim of this multicenter study was to provide insight into allergy knowledge and perceptions among the population.During the World Allergy Day, several allergy clinics conducted public meetings to encourage the awareness of and education in allergy.

However, there is an increasing body of data highlighting the disproportionate burden of HIV infection among MSM in the generalized HIV epidemics across of Southern Africa. In South Africa specifically, there has been an increase in attention focused on the risk status and preventive needs of MSM both in urban centers and peri-urban townships. The study presented here represents the first evaluation of HIV prevalence and associations of HIV infection among MSM in the peri-urban townships of Cape Town.The study consisted of an anonymous probe of 200 men, reporting ever having had sex with another man, recruited through venue-base sampling from January to February, 2009.Overall, HIV prevalence was 25.5% (n = 51/200). Of these prevalent HIV infections, only 6% of HIV-1 infected MSM were aware of their HIV status (3/50). 0% of men reported always having safe sex as defined by always wearing condoms during sex and using water-based lubricants. Independent associations with HIV infection included inconsistent condom use with male partners (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.4), having been blackmailed (aOR 4.4, 95% CI 1.6-20.2), age over 26 years (aOR 4.2, 95% CI 1.6-10.6), being unemployed (aOR 3.7, 95% CI 1.5-9.3), and rural origin (aOR 6.0, 95% CI 2.2-16.7).

The high HIV prevalence and high risk sexual practices suggest that prevalence will continue to increase among these men in the context of an otherwise slowing epidemic. These data further highlight the need to better characterize risk factors for HIV prevention and appropriate targeted combination packages of HIV interventions including biomedical, behavioural, and structural approaches to mitigate HIV risk among these men.","year":"2011","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:40.244Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:40.244Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67730c4d83dcf45b364f86","title":"Clinical evaluation of Soothing Gan (肝) and invigorating Pi (脾) acupuncture treatment on diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11655-011-0875-z","abstract":"To explore the effect of Soothing Gan (肝) and invigorating Pi (脾) (SGIP) acupuncture treatment on the clinical symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D).With a single-blinded randomized control study adopted, 63 patients who met the inclusion criteria were assigned by a random number table to two groups, 31 in the treatment group and 32 in the drug control group.

However, little is known about EMGs' own perspectives on illness treatment and use of health services. This study investigates treatment seeking strategies for child diarrhoea among ethnic minority caregivers in Northern Vietnam in order to suggest improvements to health services for EMGs and other vulnerable groups.The study obtained qualitative data from eight months of field work among four EMGs in lowland and highland villages in the Northern Lao Cai province. Triangulation of methods included in-depth interviews with 43 caregivers of pre-school children (six years and below) who had a case of diarrhoea during the past month, three focus group discussions (FGDs) with men, and two weeks of observations at two Communal Health Stations (CHGs). Data was content-analyzed by ordering data into empirically and theoretically inspired themes and sub-categories assisted by the software NVivo8.This study identified several obstacles for EMG caregivers seeking health services, including: gender roles, long travelling distances for highland villagers, concerns about the indirect costs of treatment and a reluctance to use government health facilities due to feelings of being treated disrespectfully by health staff. However, ethnic minority caregivers all recognized the danger signs of child diarrhoea and actively sought simultaneous treatment in different health care systems and home-based care. Treatments were selected by matching the perceived cause and severity of the disease with the 'compatibility' of different treatments to the child.In order to improve EMGs' use of government health services it is necessary to improve the communication skills of health staff and to acknowledge both EMGs' explanatory disease models and the significant socio-economic constraints they experience. Broader health promotion programs should address the significant gender roles preventing highland mothers from seeking health services and include family elders and fathers in future health promotion programs. Encouraging existing child health care practices, including continued breastfeeding during illness and the use of home-made rehydration solutions, also present important opportunities for future child health promotion.","year":"2011","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:48.794Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:48.794Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773144d83dcf45b364f8c","title":"Role of Emerging Antithrombotic Therapy in the Prevention of Cardioembolic Complications in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/11592410-000000000-00000","abstract":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is an independent risk factor of potentially catastrophic cardioembolic strokes. AF patients are categorized into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk for thromboembolic complications using the CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system. Oral anticoagulation using warfarin has been the standard therapy for stroke prevention in intermediate- to high-risk AF patients. However, warfarin use has been limited by several factors such as narrow therapeutic windows, drug-drug and drug-food interactions, and hemorrhagic complications. Rigorous research evaluated dual antiplatelet therapy of clopidogrel and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) as a potential alternative to warfarin in the ACTIVE W trial. Dual antiplatelet therapy of clopidogrel and aspirin was found to be inferior to warfarin in preventing stroke and systemic embolism with increased bleeding risk. Other extensive research has led to the development of new antithrombotic agents. Recently, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily, a direct thrombin inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF after it was found to be superior to warfarin in preventing thromboembolic events and associated with less bleeding in the RE-LY trial. It was also cost effective when compared with warfarin. Dabigatran can be considered in high-risk AF patients who are unable or unwilling to comply with the frequent laboratory and clinic visits that are required when receiving treatment with warfarin. Factor Xa inhibitors are another class of new anticoagulants that have been developed. Oral rivaroxaban was non-inferior to warfarin in thromboprophylaxis and with similar bleeding in the ROCKET-AF trial (HR 0.88; p=0.117). Apixaban, another factor Xa inhibitor, was superior to aspirin in reducing stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF in the AVERROES trial (HR 0.45; p<0.001). The results of the ARISTOTLE trial, which is evaluating apixaban against warfarin in ∼18 000 patients with AF, are expected to be available later this year. Edoxaban, another oral factor Xa inhibitor, is currently being evaluated against warfarin in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial in ∼20 000 patients with AF. With these new developments, there is a necessity for the clinical practitioner to become familiar with these new and upcoming therapies and guidelines. This review provides an overview of the available data regarding the clinical usefulness of these agents.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:48.794Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:48.794Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773144d83dcf45b364f8d","title":"Edoxaban","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/11595540-000000000-00000","abstract":"Edoxaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that is currently undergoing investigation in phase III clinical trials for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE).Factor Xa is an attractive target for anticoagulant treatment, as it is the primary and rate-limiting source of amplification in the coagulation cascade. Edoxaban is a competitive inhibitor of factor Xa and has >10 000-fold greater selectivity for factor Xa relative to thrombin. In phase I clinical trials, the anticoagulant effects of edoxaban included dose-dependent increases in activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time following single edoxaban doses of 10–150 mg and after multiple ascending doses (60 mg twice daily, 90 mg daily and 120 mg daily). The anticoagulant effects of edoxaban were rapid in onset (time to peak plasma concentration 1–2 hours) and sustained for up to 24 hours. Prolongation of bleeding time in 8% of subjects was >9.5 minutes (none of which appeared to be clinically significant) 2 hours after initial dosing, and was independent of edoxaban dose, formulation or dietary state. In general, plasma edoxaban concentrations were linearly correlated with coagulation parameters. Phase II clinical trials in patients with AF and VTE suggest that the edoxaban 30 mg once-daily and 60 mg once-daily regimens had a similar or better safety profile compared with dose-adjusted warfarin (international normalized ratio 2.0-3.0) in terms of bleeding events, and that edoxaban was not associated with hepatotoxicity. In addition, edoxaban was associated with statistically significant dose-dependent reductions in VTE after orthopaedic surgery compared with placebo or dalteparin sodium.

Setting Prospective study, medication review, from January 2007 to December 2009 in ten nursing homes affiliated to the Pharmacie interjurassienne (PIJ), Switzerland. Method Medication use data were collected and reviewed by a pharmacist, focusing on drug indication, dosing, side effects, renal/hepatic elimination and interactions. Drug-related problems (DRPs) were discussed face-to-face with the responsible physician and a nurse. The pharmaceutical care issues were formulated and medication interventions proposed during this meeting. DRPs and interventions were documented using the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe scheme version 5.00 (PCNE V5.00). The economic impact of the service was estimated through a retrospective evaluation of annual drug costs. A satisfaction evaluation was conducted among practitioners and nurses. Main outcome measures DRPs, interventions, treatment changes implemented. Results Drug therapy of 329 patients was reviewed. The number of medicines per patient ranged from 2 to 27 (mean 12.8). A total of 1,225 DRPs were detected and discussed with the physician and the nurse. Medication review led to 343 medical evaluations secondary to drug-drug interactions and 803 treatment adaptations: 373 drugs were stopped, 197 dosages changed, 95 instructions for use amended, 86 drug choices were altered, 35 drug formulations changed and 17 new drugs started.

Early reports suggested that procainamide and hydralazine were associated with the highest risk of developing lupus, quinidine with a moderate risk and all other drugs were considered low or very low risk. More recently, drug-induced lupus has been associated with the use of the newer biological modulators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors and interferons. The clinical features and laboratory findings of TNFα inhibitor-induced lupus are different from that of traditional drug-induced lupus or idiopathic lupus, and standardized criteria for the diagnosis of drug-induced lupus have not been established. The mechanism(s) responsible for the development of drug-induced lupus may vary depending on the drug or even on the patient. Besides lupus, other autoimmune diseases have been associated with drugs or toxins. Diagnosis of drug-induced lupus requires identification of a temporal relationship between drug administration and symptom development, and in traditional drug-induced lupus there must be no pre-existing lupus. Resolution of symptoms generally occurs after cessation of the drug.In this review, we will discuss those drugs that are more commonly associated with drug-induced lupus, with an emphasis on the new biologicals and the difficulty of making the diagnosis of drug-induced lupus against a backdrop of the autoimmune diseases that these drugs are used to treat. Stimulation of the immune system by these drugs to cause autoimmunity may in fact be associated with an increased effectiveness in treating the pathology for which they are prescribed, leading to the dilemma of deciding which is worse, the original disease or the adverse effect of the drug. Optimistically, one must hope that ongoing research in drug development and in pharmacogenetics will help to treat patients with the maximum effectiveness while minimizing side effects. Vigilance and early diagnosis are critical. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most recent developments in our understanding of the incidence, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of drug-induced lupus.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:53.482Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:19:53.482Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773194d83dcf45b364f97","title":"Pharmacokinetics of Anti-tuberculosis Drugs in Children","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12098-010-0304-x","abstract":"Tuberculosis (TB) is among the top 10 causes of death among children worldwide.

Most efforts to date have focused on disproportionality analysis, but the empirical support for its value is based on isolated examples. Additionally, too little attention has been given to the potential value of the detailed content of ICSRs for improved adverse drug interaction surveillance. Objective: The aim of the study was to identify reporting patterns indicative of suspected adverse drug interactions before the drug interactions are generally established. Methods: A reference set of known adverse drug interactions and drug pairs not known to interact was constructed from information added to Stockley’s Drug Interactions Alerts between the first quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2009. The reference set was used to systematically study differences in reporting patterns between adverse drug interactions before they are generally established and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to drug pairs that are not known to interact, in the WHO Global ICSR Database, VigiBase. The scope of the study included pharmacological properties such as common cytochrome P450 metabolism, explicit suspicions of drug interactions as noted by the reporter, clinical details such as dose and treatment overlap, and the lower limit of the 95% credibility interval of a three-way measure of disproportionality, Omega025 (Ω025), based on the total number of reports on two drugs and one ADR together. Analyses were carried out including and excluding concomitant medicines. Results: Five reporting patterns were highlighted as particularly strong indicators of adverse drug interactions before they are known: suspicion of interactions as noted by the reporter in a case narrative, the assignment of the two drugs as interacting or through an ADR term; co-reporting of effect increased with the drug pair; and, finally, an excess total number of reports on the ADR together with the two drugs, as measured by Ω025. Overall, the inclusion of concomitant medicines led to a larger number of true adverse drug interactions being highlighted, but at a substantial decrease in the strength of most indicators. Notably, the inclusion of concomitant medicines completely eliminated the value of Ω025 as an indicator of adverse drug interactions, in this systematic evaluation. Conclusions: Reported suspicion of interactions as noted by the reporter in a case narrative, the assignment of the two drugs as interacting or through an ADR term; co-reporting of effect increased with the drug pair and by the Ω025 each provide unique information to highlight adverse drug interactions before they become known in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis demonstrating the value of disproportionality analysis for adverse drug interactions using a comprehensive reference set, and the first study to consider a broader basis including clinical information for systematic drug interaction surveillance.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:02.231Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:02.231Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773224d83dcf45b364f9f","title":"Pharmacokinetic Optimization of Antiretroviral Therapy in Children and Adolescents","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/11539260-000000000-00000","abstract":"There are over 2.1 million HIV-infected children worldwide, who are increasingly exposed to antiretroviral therapy.

We analyzed primary and secondary sources using situational and discourse analyses. We introduced the concepts of biomedicalization and biopedagogy, which allowed us to analyze how medicalization was radicalized.In the 1990s, structural adjustment policies facilitated health reforms that allowed the entrance of multinational financial capital into publicly-financed and employer-based insurance. This model operated in contraposition to the interests of the medical industrial complex, which since the middle of the 1990s had developed silent reforms to regain authority in defining the health-ill-care model. These silent reforms radicalized the medicalization. Some reforms took place through deregulatory processes, such as allowing direct-to-consumer advertisements of prescription drugs in the United States. In other countries different strategies were facilitated by the lack of regulation of other media such as the internet. The pharmaceutical industry also has had a role in changing disease definitions, rebranding others, creating new ones, and pressuring for approval of treatments to be paid by public, employer, and private plans. In recent years in Brazil there has been a substantial increase in the number of judicial claims demanding that public administrations pay for new treatments.We found that the dispute for the hegemony of the health sector between financial and pharmaceutical companies has deeply transformed the sector. Patients converted into consumers are exposed to the biomedicalization of their lives helped by the biopedagogies, which using subtle mechanisms present discourses as if they are objective and created to empower consumers. The analysis of judicialization of health policies in Brazil could help to understand the complexity of the problem and to develop democratic mechanisms to improve the regulation of the health sector.","year":"2011","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:02.231Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:02.231Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773224d83dcf45b364fa2","title":"Pharmacologic Considerations for Oseltamivir Disposition","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/11536950-000000000-00000","abstract":"Across much of the world, pandemic H1N1 infection has produced a significant healthcare crisis, reflected in significant morbidity and mortality. Statistics reveal that infection-associated deaths among individuals without pre-existing conditions (e.g. immunosuppression) are clustered in pregnant women and young infants. In developing countries where the availability of influenzae vaccine is limited, the only currently available pharmacologic counter-measure for H1N1 disease is oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor with excellent in vitro activity against the virus. This drug is available in oral solid and liquid formulations, has excellent peroral bioavailability in adults, and generally has a very favorable safety profile.Many observational studies indicate that oseltamivir treatment is associated with symptomatic improvement in pediatric patients with H1N1 infection and, therefore, is considered to represent a viable therapeutic option for use in children. However, the disposition of the ethyl ester prodrug and its active metabolite has not been well characterized in infants and children. Presently, data are available from only two published investigations and preliminary summary information from a recent presentation of an ongoing study. Given that recent in vitro data support the importance of a target exposure-response profile for the active metabolite of oseltamivir and that many processes known to modulate drug disposition have a developmental basis, understanding the potential impact of age on oseltamivir disposition becomes crucial in the development of age-appropriate dosing regimens for the drug.In this review, the impact of ontogeny on processes that are important in regulating the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of oseltamivir and its active metabolite are considered. Data from both animal and human investigations are presented in the context of defining how development might influence the dose-exposure relationship and, most importantly, the significant variability associated with it. In addition, the available pediatric pharmacokinetic data for oseltamivir and its active metabolite are summarized and current ‘information gaps’ deserving of future study are presented.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:02.231Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:02.231Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773254d83dcf45b364fa3","title":"Why pharmacokinetic differences among oral triptans have little clinical importance: a comment","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10194-010-0258-4","abstract":"Triptans, selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists, are specific drugs for the acute treatment of migraine that have the same mechanism of action.

The primary mechanism through which interactions are mediated is mechanism-based intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition by furanocoumarins resulting in increased bioavailability of administered medications that are substrates. Grapefruit products have also been associated with interactions with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and uptake transporters (e.g. organic anion-transporting polypeptides [OATPs]). Polyphenolic compounds such as flavonoids have been proposed as the causative agents of the P-gp and OATP interactions. The mechanisms and magnitudes of the interactions can be influenced by the concentrations of furanocoumarins and flavonoids in the grapefruit product, the volume of juice consumed, and the inherent variability of specific enzymes and transporter components in humans. It is therefore challenging to predict the extent of grapefruit product-drug interactions and to compare available in vitro and in vivo data. The clinical significance of such interactions also depends on the disposition and toxicity profile of the drug being administered. The aim of this review is to outline the mechanisms of grapefruit-drug interactions and present a comprehensive summary of those agents affected and whether they are likely to be of clinical relevance.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:11.827Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:11.827Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67732b4d83dcf45b364fb4","title":"Perforin level in CD4+ T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00296-009-1329-1","abstract":"CD4+ T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) exhibit increased expression of various proteins contributing to defective function of CD4+ T cells.

The AGnES-concept (general practitioner-relieving, community-based, e-health assisted, systemic intervention) is based on the delegation of original physician-activities to qualified AGnES-practice assistants. Purposes of AGnES part 1 were to determine the feasibility of community-based home medication reviews (HMR) and the establishment of a health professional network to identify drug related problems (DRP) in the domicile of elderly patients. Two consecutive studies (AGNES 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3) were conducted to implement HMR. Setting General practices on the isle of Rugia in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, a German rural area. Patients who receive regular home visits by their GP were addressed. Method Study-instruments for the feasibility study (AGnES 1) were designed by an expert panel and modified for the implementation (AGnES 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3) studies. HMR were conducted by additionally qualified AGnES-practice assistants regarding DRP like drug–drug interaction (DDI), adverse drug reactions (ADR), and compliance. DRP-selection was inspired by the coding system Pi-Doc. Pharmacists checked DRP and intervened, if necessary. 18 (AGnES 1) and 60 (AGnES 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3) geriatric patients received a minimum of two home visits by an AGnES-practice assistant. Main outcome measure Feasibility was assessed by patients’ satisfaction with care provided by the AGnES-practice assistant. For implementation reported DRP and the conducted interventions were evaluated. Results During AGnES 1 a documentation sheet was developed and tested. 56 potential DDI were identified. 37 of 112 drugs which caused potential interactions were attributed to OTC medication and food components. 84% of respondents judged the systematic evaluation of their pharmacotherapy as helpful. During AGnES 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3 local pharmacists identified DDIs in 45% of patients. Seven patients (11.6%) reported at least one ADR attributable to their current medication.

The purpose of the study was to explore beliefs about health and illness that might affect self-care practice and health care seeking behaviour in persons diagnosed with DM, living in Zimbabwe.Exploratory study. Consecutive sample from a diabetes clinic at a central hospital. Semi-structured interviews were held with 21 persons aged 19-65 years.

A mixture of causes of DM, predominantly individual factors such as heredity, overweight and wrong diet in combination with supernatural factors such as fate, punishment from God and witchcraft were mentioned. Most respondents did not recognize the symptoms of DM when falling ill but related the problems to other diseases, e.g. HIV, malaria etc. Limited knowledge about DM and the body was indicated. Poor economy was mentioned as harmful to health and a consequence of DM because the need to buy expensive drugs, food and attend check-ups.

Barriers to the use of appropriate thromboprophylaxis include the belief by some surgeons that pharmacological thromboprophylaxis increases the risk of bleeding and the asymptomatic nature of deep vein thrombosis. In addition, in patients at risk of VTE, thromboprophylaxis should be given beyond the standard duration recommended in international or national guidelines, and many surgeons have concerns about adherence and adverse events in the outpatient setting. Furthermore, currently available anticoagulants have drawbacks, including the need for monitoring, or a subcutaneous route of administration.

By definition, for highly variable drugs (HVDs), the estimated within-subject variability is >30%. HVDs often fail to meet current regulatory acceptance criteria for average bioequivalence (ABE). The determination of the bioequivalence of HVDs has been a vexing problem since the inception of the current regulations. It is of concern not only to the generic industry but also to the innovator industry. This article reviews the definition of HVDs, the present regulatory recommendations and the approaches proposed in the literature to deal with the bioequivalence problems of HVDs. The approach of scaled ABE (SABE) is proposed as the most adequate procedure to solve the problem. It is demonstrated that SABE has firm theoretical foundations. In fact, statistical tests similar to SABE are used in various fields, such as psychology and quality control. Algorithms and numerical examples are presented to calculate SABE from the data in conventional two-period and replicate-design studies. The most important feature of SABE is that a fixed sample size is adequate to demonstrate bioequivalence regardless of within-subject variability. The conditions for reaching consistent regulatory decisions with SABE are discussed. The required sample size, for a given statistical power, depends on the regulatory criteria. Sample sizes with different criteria are demonstrated and compared with those arising from a recent informal US FDA proposal.Pragmatic considerations lead to modifications of the theoretical concept of SABE. Several modifications are proposed, including reference scaling, restriction on the estimated geometric mean ratios and possibly limiting SABE to only secondary bioequivalence metrics such as the maximum concentration. Each proposal has its own merit but is also a source of new controversy. Overall, the statistical evaluation of SABE is more complex than that of ABE, which means higher regulatory burden. Standardized open software could be very useful in this regard.

Nigeria is one of a number of countries whose pharmaceutical system has been impacted by corruption and has struggled to curtail the production and trafficking of substandard drugs. In 2001, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) underwent an organizational restructuring resulting in reforms to reduce counterfeit drugs and better regulate pharmaceuticals [2]. Despite these changes, there is still room for improvement. This study assessed the perceived level of transparency and potential vulnerability to corruption that exists in four essential areas of Nigeria's pharmaceutical sector: registration, procurement, inspection (divided into inspection of ports and of establishments), and distribution.Standardized questionnaires were adapted from the World Health Organization assessment tool and used in semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders in the public and private pharmaceutical system. The responses to the questions were tallied and converted to scores on a numerical scale where lower scores suggested greater vulnerability to corruption and higher scores suggested lower vulnerability.The overall score for Nigeria's pharmaceutical system was 7.4 out of 10, indicating a system that is marginally vulnerable to corruption. The weakest links were the areas of drug registration and inspection of ports. Analysis of the qualitative results revealed that the perceived level of corruption did not always match the qualitative evidence.Despite the many reported reforms instituted by NAFDAC, the study findings suggest that facets of the pharmaceutical system in Nigeria remain fairly vulnerable to corruption. The most glaring deficiency seems to be the absence of conflict of interest guidelines which, if present and consistently administered, limit the promulgation of corrupt practices. Other major contributing factors are the inconsistency in documentation of procedures, lack of public availability of such documentation, and inadequacies in monitoring and evaluation. What is most critical from this study is the identification of areas that still remain permeable to corruption and, perhaps, where more appropriate checks and balances are needed from the Nigerian government and the international community.","year":"2009","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:30.623Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:30.623Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67733e4d83dcf45b364fd7","title":"Pain Treatment with Opioids","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/0044011-200929001-00002","abstract":"Appropriate and successful management of pain with opioid analgesics is based on tailoring pharmacologic treatment to the individual and identifying the minimal effective dose at which pain is controlled with minimal adverse effects. Morphine and morphine-like-agonists exhibit similar pharmacodynamic profiles, but substantially different receptor affinities and pharmacokinetic properties, which dictate the dosage, route and regimen required to achieve analgesic effect. Opioids exhibit differences in drug elimination resulting in marked variations in the plasma half-life value. Although fentanyl is more potent than morphine, with a shorter duration of action than parenteral morphine, its oral bioavailability is poor and it is administered transdermally. Morphine, with a short half-life and a time to steady-state plasma concentrations of 10–12 hours is better suited than transdermal fentanyl for initial opioid therapy and for the treatment of unstable pain, which requires a fluctuating opioid dose. International guidelines recommend normal-release morphine for initial optimization of individual dose because its pharmacokinetics allow ‘real-time’ dose regimen changes and rapid identification of the dose required for pain control. Once an effective normal-release morphine dosage is achieved, other administration routes, formulations and opioids can be considered as required. Despite guidelines advocating that transdermal fentanyl should only be used in patients who are shown to be tolerant to strong opioid therapy, in Italy and other European countries, controlled-release or transdermal opioids are often used when starting opioid therapy. Opioids are associated with a wide range of adverse reactions, but these can be minimized with careful drug titration and maintenance. A major challenge with pain control is polypharmacy and the risk of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions. Prevention and management of interactions rely on careful and timely adjustment of drug regimens involved, according to the severity of the effect. Dose titration is the key to successful therapy initiation with strong opioids in patients with moderate-to-severe pain. It is the only way to establish the optimal and minimal effective dose and provides the best protection against adverse effects. Committed physicians should adhere to guidelines on the appropriate use of opioids in all patients, particularly those with a high risk of adverse reactions.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:30.623Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:30.623Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773414d83dcf45b364fd9","title":"Time Interval and the Factors Associated with the Development of Asthma in Patients with Allergic Rhinitis","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00408-009-9179-x","abstract":"Rhinitis and asthma commonly coexist and studies have shown a positive association between rhinitis and asthma in both atopic and nonatopic adults.

The first case was optimized without knowledge of the POM. After a 2-hour lecture on the POM, the GPs used the POM to optimize the medication of the second case history. The GPs were allowed 20 minutes for case optimization. Medication recommendations were compared with those made by an expert panel of four geriatricians specialized in clinical pharmacology.

In addition, we estimated direct and indirect associations among independent variables in the logistic regression models and transactional sex using structural equation models. The analysis shows that factors associated with women selling and buying sex include being homeless, use of stimulants, bisexual behavior, and neighborhood disorder. There was also a significant difference by race. For men, the factors associated with selling and buying sex include being homeless, bisexual behavior, and not being in a relationship. Although neighborhood violence and disorder show significance in bivariate associations with the outcome, these associations disappear in the structural equation models.","year":"2009","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:33.907Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:33.907Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773414d83dcf45b364fde","title":"Medication and food issues for overactive bladder/lower urinary tract symptoms: When do we eat?","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11884-009-0014-2","abstract":"Overactive bladder (OAB) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common conditions that often require chronic medications.

Our review shows that the available evidence is mixed concerning the effectiveness of interventions by pharmacists on pharmacotherapy in the nursing home setting. At the same time, greater pharmacist involvement has been shown in published studies to increase physicians’ and nurses’ knowledge and awareness about medication.

The project was aimed at developing a better understanding of the harms associated with crack cocaine smoking and determining the feasibility of introducing specific harm reduction strategies. Specifically, in partnership with the community, we constructed and distributed kits that contained harm reduction materials. We were particularly interested in understanding what people thought of these kits and how the kits contents were used. To obtain this information, we conducted 27 interviews with women and men who used crack cocaine and received safer crack kits. Four broad themes were generated from the data: 1) the context of crack use practices; 2) learning/transmission of harm reducon education; 3) changing practice; 4) barriers to change. This project suggests that harm reduction education is most successful when it is informed by current practices with crack use. In addition it is most effectively delivered through informal interactions with people who use crack and includes repeated demonstrations of harm reduction equipment by peers and outreach workers.

It includes nutrition, lifestyle, self-medication, hygiene, socio-economic and environmental factors. Self-care has been with us for thousands of years, but today there is an opportunity for pharmacists to assist patients with self-care. Society is better educated than ever before and now has access to accurate, understandable and objective, up-to-date information about drug therapies. Moreover, there is a general trend to take back control from physicians and other care-givers, and for patients to make decisions about their own care. Additional drugs are becoming available OTC and some information may require professional interpretation. On a parallel plane, the pharmacist is being recognized as a trustworthy source of information and advice. When these trends interact, there becomes a golden opportunity for pharmacists to demonstrate their worth to their patients. This report provides the perspectives from numerous sources as to the future role of the pharmacist in self-care.","year":"2008","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:53.049Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:53.049Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773554d83dcf45b364ffd","title":"Eating beyond satiety and body mass index","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03327612","abstract":" OBJECTIVE: To examine discrete eating behaviours as predictors of body mass and psychological processes through which these behaviours might lead to increased body mass.

Dabigatran etexilate is an orally administered prodrug, which is rapidly absorbed and converted to the active form, dabigatran. Dabigatran has been shown to specifically and reversibly inhibit thrombin, the key enzyme in the coagulation cascade. Studies in healthy volunteers and in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery have indicated that dabigatran has a predictable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, allowing for a fixed-dose regimen. Peak plasma concentrations of dabigatran are reached approximately 2 hours after oral administration in healthy volunteers, with no unexpected accumulation of drug concentrations upon multiple dosing. Excretion is predominantly via the renal route as unchanged drug. Dabigatran is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The small differences in dabigatran pharmacokinetics associated with age and gender are attributed to variations in renal function. Additional studies have shown that the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of dabigatran is consistent across a range of patient populations, with no effect of moderate hepatic impairment being observed. Drug-drug interactions are not observed with concomitant administration of atorvastatin, diclofenac or digoxin. The pharmacodynamic profile of dabigatran demonstrates effective anticoagulation combined with a low risk of bleeding. Further phase III studies are ongoing, including acute VTE treatment and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation; the results obtained so far show that dabigatran etexilate is well tolerated and effective in the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:53.050Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:53.050Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67735b4d83dcf45b365009","title":"The Effect of Computerized Physician Order Entry with Clinical Decision Support on the Rates of Adverse Drug Events: A Systematic Review","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-008-0504-5","abstract":"Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) with clinical decision support (CDS) has been promoted as an effective strategy to prevent the development of a drug injury defined as an adverse drug event (ADE).To systematically review studies evaluating the effects of CPOE with CDS on the development of an ADE as an outcome measure.PUBMED versions of MEDLINE (from inception through March 2007) were searched to identify relevant studies.

Method Searches in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library were conducted. Bibliographies of retrieved articles were examined for additional references. Only papers in English between 1980 and 2007 were included. Results In systemic cancer therapy there is an enormous potential for DRP due to the high toxicity and the complexity of most therapeutic regimens. The most frequently reported DRP can be classified into adverse effects, drug–drug interactions, medication errors, and non-adherence. Pharmacists have enhanced efforts to assure quality and safety in systemic cancer therapy together with other health care providers. In consequence, oncology pharmacy has evolved as a novel specialist discipline. The endeavour to merge and co-ordinate individual activities and services of the pharmacist has led to pharmaceutical care concepts which aim at offering novel solutions to the various DRP. Conclusion Pharmaceutical care for cancer patients should be developed within research projects and integrated into disease management programs in order to ensure broad implementation.","year":"2007","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:59.514Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:59.514Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67735b4d83dcf45b36500b","title":"Pediatric Angioedema","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12016-007-8037-y","abstract":"Angioedema is a self-limited nonpitting edema generally affecting the deeper layers of the skin and mucous membranes. It is the result of increased vascular permeability causing the leakage of fluid into the skin in response to potent vasodilators released by immunologic mediators. Two main pathways are thought to be implicated in angioedema. The mast cell pathway in which preformed mediators, such as histamine, rapidly formed mediators, leukotrienes and prostaglandins, are released from mast cells through IgE or direct activation. This is the most common pathway among children, with food, medications, and infections commonly implicated. The second pathway is the kinin pathway, most notably affected by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and hereditary forms of angioedema, which ultimately results in the formation of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. Angioedema is being encountered with increasing frequency, particularly among children and is important to recognize and treat for its life-threatening associated manifestations such as anaphylaxis and airway obstruction. Although angioedema is still not fully understood, we have broadened our understanding of the possible causes and clinical course of angioedema. An understanding of these potential causes and mechanisms by which angioedema can occur may guide the clinician in determining the need for diagnostic testing and the extent of treatment.","year":"2007","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:59.514Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:20:59.514Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773724d83dcf45b365023","title":"Decreased Serum Glucose Levels after Initiation of Methylphenidate in a Patient Status Post-Cerebellar Tumour Resection","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00044011-200727100-00007","abstract":"Pharmacological intervention with methylphenidate to address the neurobehavioural deficits associated with various neurological disorders has increased during the past decade.

Thus, the serotonin system has provided a viable target for weight control, critical to the action of at least two effective anti-obesity treatments, both producing clinically significant weight loss over a year or more. Numerous serotonin receptor subtypes have been identified; of these, serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors have been specifically recognised as mediators of serotonin-induced satiety.A number of serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), dexfenfluramine and 5-HT2C receptor agonists, have been shown to significantly attenuate rodent bodyweight gain. This effect is strongly associated with marked hypophagia and is probably mediated by the hypothalamic melanocortin system. Additionally, sibutramine, dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine and the 5-HT2C receptor agonist chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) have all been shown to modify appetite in both lean and obese humans, resulting in reduced caloric intake. Clinical studies demonstrate serotonergic drugs specifically reduce appetite prior to and following the consumption of fixed caloric loads, and cause a reduction in pre-meal appetite and caloric intake at ad libitum meals. Weight loss in the obese has also been produced by treatment with both the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan and the preferential 5-HT2C receptor agonist mCPP.A new generation of 5-HT2C receptor selective agonists have been developed and at least one, lorcaserin (APD356), is currently undergoing clinical trials. In addition, 5-HT6 receptor antagonists such as PRX-07034 and BVT74316 have been shown to potently reduce food intake and bodyweight gain in rodent models and have recently entered clinical trials. However, the role of the 5-HT6 receptor in the expression of appetite remains to be determined. The hope is that these drugs will not only be free of their predecessors’ adverse effect profiles, but will also be equally or more effective at regulating appetite and controlling bodyweight.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:21:28.281Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:21:28.281Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773784d83dcf45b365030","title":"Predicting Pharmacokinetic Food Effects Using Biorelevant Solubility Media and Physiologically Based Modelling","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003088-200645120-00006","abstract":" Background: Food-induced changes in gastric emptying time, gastric pH and/or intestinal fluid composition may have an impact on the pharmacokinetics of drugs.

Among all youth, 32% perceived a need for help with mental health problems and 15% met Brief-Symptom Inventory (BSI) criteria for emotional distress. The rate of mental health service use in our sample was 32%. One enabling factor, having a case manager/discussed mental health concerns, and one need factor, which met criteria for BSI, were found to be associated with mental health service use in the past 3&nbsp;months. The majority of youth who used mental health services had obtained services from crisis centers. Among those who perceived a need for help with mental health problems but who did not use services, the most common barrier was not knowing where to go or what service to use (57%). These findings suggest that due to the high prevalence of mental health problems among homeless youth, it would be helpful for service providers coming into contact with youth to make them aware of existing community resources for mental health services; making youth aware of these resources may in turn decrease the rate of crisis center use and instead allow youth to receive mental health services in outpatient settings that provide continuity of care.","year":"2006","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:21:32.160Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:21:32.160Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67737c4d83dcf45b36503b","title":"Health workforce issues and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria: an analytical review","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1478-4491-4-23","abstract":"Recent studies have shown evidence of a direct and positive causal link between the number of health workers and health outcomes.

Global health initiatives are faced with human resources issues as a major, system-wide constraint. This article explores how the Global Fund addresses the challenges of a health workforce bottleneck to the successful implementation of priority disease programmes.Possibilities for investment in human resources in the Global Fund's policy documents and guidelines are reviewed. This is followed by an in-depth study of 35 Global Fund proposals from five African countries: Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania. The discussion presents specific human resources interventions that can be found in proposals. Finally, the comments on human resources interventions in the Global Fund's Technical Review Panel and the budget allocation for human resources for health were examined.Policy documents and guidelines of the Global Fund foster taking account of human resources constraints in recipient countries and interventions to address them. However, the review of actual proposals clearly shows that countries do not often take advantage of their opportunities and focus mainly on short-term, in-service training in their human resources components.The comments of the Technical Review Panel on proposed health system-strengthening interventions reveal a struggle between the Global Fund's goal to fight the three targeted diseases, on the one hand, and the need to strengthen health systems as a prerequisite for success, on the other. In realizing the opportunities the Global Fund provides for human resources interventions, countries should go beyond short-term objectives and link their activities to a long-term development of their human resources for health.","year":"2006","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:21:32.160Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:21:32.160Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67737c4d83dcf45b36503a","title":"Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Pharmacogenetic Tests as Tools in Pharmacovigilance","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00002018-200629090-00001","abstract":"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and pharmacogenetic tests play a major role in minimising adverse drug reactions and enhancing optimal therapeutic response. The response to medication varies greatly between individuals, according to genetic constitution, age, sex, co-morbidities, environmental factors including diet and lifestyle (e.g. smoking and alcohol intake), and drug-related factors such as pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions.

This review sets out evidence to show that inappropriate use of antidepressants (i.e. outside clinical indications, in excessive doses and for prolonged periods) constitutes a concerning public health problem. Antidepressant prescribing increased by between 4- and 10-fold in various age groups and countries in the last decade of the 20th century. The population of severely depressed patients (in whom antidepressants are accepted to be an effective treatment) who are not receiving antidepressants is probably much smaller than the population receiving these drugs inappropriately. We sound a note of caution for depression awareness campaigns. These apparently well-reasoned responses to the perceived under-recognition of depression can exacerbate over-prescribing.

Previous surveys have assessed reasons for underuse of anticoagulation but have limitations including non-structured approach for eliciting barriers and use of clinical vignettes and not patient-level data. The objectives of this study were to develop a questionnaire to assess barriers to anticoagulation use for stroke prophylaxis in AF patients at a patient- and physician-level and to conduct a preliminary field-test of the instrument.Methods: Barriers to warfarin use were identified from a literature review, input from clinical experts, and a physician focus group. A sample of US physicians who treat AF patients completed the questionnaire. Physicians ranked their reluctance on a 1–10 scale (10 = very reluctant) in general to prescribe warfarin if a specific barrier was present in a patient and then indicated critical barriers to prescribing warfarin in a sample of their own AF patients not receiving warfarin.Results: Forty-one barriers to warfarin use were identified and classified into 4 groups: patient medical characteristics (n = 17), health care system factors (n = 7), patient capability (n = 12), and patient preferenc (n = 5). Several new items were developed (e.g., difficulty in obtaining venous access), existing items were revised (e.g., timeframe for bleeding episodes subdivided into > or ≤ 3 months), and multi-factorial barriers (e.g., dementia, epilepsy) were explored. The factor that most strongly influenced physicians' (n = 30) decisions not to prescribe warfarin was severe bleeding < 3 months ago (mean ± SD: 9.2 ± 1.3) while the most prevalent critical barriers to prescribing warfarin in specific AF patients (n = 24) was patient unwilling to undergo repeat testing (29%).Conclusion: This questionnaire has the potential to assist in better understanding barriers to warfarin use with a view to addressing and then overcoming warfarin underutilization. Preliminary data suggest patient preference and capabilities are at least as important as medical characteristics as barriers to prescribing warfarin in AF patients.","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:21:39.030Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:21:39.030Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773834d83dcf45b365043","title":"Practical Considerations for the Treatment of Elderly Patients with Migraine","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00002512-200623060-00003","abstract":"Treatment of migraine presents special problems in the elderly. Co-morbid diseases may prohibit the use of some medications. Moreover, even when these contraindications do not exist, older patients are more likely than younger ones to develop adverse events. Managing older migraine patients, therefore, necessitates particular caution, including taking into account possible pharmacological interactions associated with the greater use of drugs for concomitant diseases in the elderly.Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the safest drug for symptomatic treatment of migraine in the elderly. Use of selective serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists (‘triptans’) is not recommended, even in the absence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risk, and NSAID use should be limited because of potential gastrointestinal adverse effects.Prophylactic treatments include antidepressants, β-adrenoceptor antagonists, calcium channel antagonists and antiepileptics. Selection of a drug from one of these classes should be dictated by the patient’s co-morbidities. β-Adrenoceptor antagonists are appropriate in patients with hypertension but are contraindicated in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure and peripheral vascular disease. Use of antidepressants in low doses is, in general, well tolerated by elderly people and as effective, overall, as in young adults. This approach is preferred in patients with concomitant mood disorders. However, prostatism, glaucoma and heart disease make the use of tricyclic antidepressants more difficult. Fewer efficacy data in the elderly are available for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which can be tried in particular cases because of their good tolerability profile. Calcium channel antagonists are contraindicated in patients with hypotension, heart failure, atrioventricular block, Parkinson’s disease or depression (flunarizine), and in those taking β-adrenoceptor antagonists and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (verapamil). Antiepileptic drug use should be limited to migraine with high frequency of attacks and refractoriness to other treatments. Promising additional strategies include ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists because of their effectiveness and good tolerability in patients with migraine, particularly in those with hypertension. Because of its favourable compliance and safety profile, botulinum toxin type A can be considered an alternative treatment in elderly migraine patients who have not responded to other currently available migraine prophylactic agents.Pharmacological treatment of migraine poses special problems in regard to both symptomatic and prophylactic treatment. Contraindications to triptan use, adverse effects of NSAIDs, and unwanted reactions to some antiemetics reduce the list of drugs available for the treatment of migraine attacks in elderly patients. The choice of prophylactic treatment (β-adrenoceptor antagonists, calcium channel antagonists, antiepileptics, and more recently, some antihypertensive drugs) is influenced by co-morbidities and should be directed at those drugs that are believed to have fewer adverse effects and a better safety profile. Unfortunately, for most of these drugs, efficacy studies are lacking in the elderly.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:21:39.030Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:21:39.030Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773884d83dcf45b365045","title":"Unprotected Sexual Behavior Among Heterosexual HIV-Positive Injection Drug Using Men: Associations by Partner Type and Partner Serostatus","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11524-006-9066-1","abstract":"Few studies have examined sexual risk behaviors of HIV-positive, heterosexual, injection drug using (IDU) men.

Allergic rhinitis, an inflammatory response to an allergen, affects an estimated 20–40 million people in the US, while chronic idiopathic urticaria is a dermatoallergic condition that affects 0.1–3% of people in the US and Europe. The primary goals of treatment for allergic rhinitis are to reduce symptoms, which include sneezing, rhinorrhoea and nasal congestion, improve quality of life and prevent the sequelae associated with this disease, while the goal for chronic idiopathic urticaria is the rapid and prolonged control of symptoms. Quantitatively, histamine is the most abundant mediator present during an allergic episode — thus, antihistamines (historically called histamine H1 receptor antagonists, now called H1 receptor inverse agonists) are a first-line defense against allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. Although first-generation antihistamines can cause sedation and cognitive impairment, second-generation antihistamines are relatively nonsedating and free of such adverse events owing to their comparative inability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Desloratadine is one such second-generation antihistamine and is indicated for the treatment of allergic diseases, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. It has proven efficacy against the symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, including nasal congestion, and chronic idiopathic urticaria. As a result, it has been shown to improve patients’ quality of life. The safety and efficacy profiles of desloratadine are well established, and published postmarketing analyses have assessed >54 000 patients. Although earlier second-generation antihistamines have been associated with cardiovascular adverse effects, desloratadine has been shown to be safe and well tolerated at nine times the recommended dose. In addition, it has been shown to not interact with concomitantly administered drugs and food. Overall, current data indicate that desloratadine is a safe and effective treatment for allergic diseases.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:21:56.226Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:21:56.226Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773944d83dcf45b365056","title":"Expression of human endogenous retrovirus clone 4-1 may correlate with blood plasma concentration of anti-U1 RNP and anti-Sm nuclear antibodies","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10067-005-1123-8","abstract":"The transcription of human endogenous retrovirus E (HERV-E) clone 4-1 was determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

On 12 May 2005, the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) reached an important milestone when it adopted the final texts for clinical (ICH topic E14) and non-clinical (ICH topic S7B) strategies by which drugs should be investigated for their potential to induce these effects during their development.ICH E14 provides recommendations to sponsors concerning the design, conduct, analysis and interpretation of clinical studies to assess the potential of a drug to delay cardiac repolarisation. Specifically, it calls for a clinical ‘thorough QT/QTc study’ (typically conducted in healthy volunteers), which is intended to determine whether a drug has a threshold pharmacological effect on cardiac repolarisation, as detected by QT/QTc interval prolongation. The E14 recommendations are generally applicable not only to new drugs that have systemic bioavailability but also to approved drugs when a new dose, route of administration or target population that may result in an increased risk is explored. The guideline provides for exceptions when this study may not be required.Recognising the fractious relationship between ICH E14 and ICH S7B, and the persistence of a number of issues that may require clarity and/or the emergence of other new scientific issues in the future, the ICH Steering Committee has formed an Implementation Working Group that is charged with providing clarity on aspects of the guideline that are ambiguous and responding to issues on which the sponsors are uncertain. This paper provides a commentary on some of the challenges that are likely to be faced by the sponsors of drugs during the next few years of application of these two guidelines. The adoption of these guidelines has left a number of questions unanswered and raised some new ones. When in doubt, the sponsor should seek formal regulatory clarity before making key decisions that may impact further development, assessment and approval of a new chemical entity. Although the goal of developing drugs with much lower torsadogenic potential and without inappropriate restriction in the use (or even rejection) of potentially beneficial drugs is within sight, it is questionable whether the risk of drug-induced proarrhythmia will be eliminated completely.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:05.250Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:05.250Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67739d4d83dcf45b365058","title":"Mesenteric Inflammatory Veno-occlusive Disease as a Cause of Acute Abdomen: Report of Five Cases","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00595-004-3036-6","abstract":"Mesenteric inflammatory veno-occlusive disease (MIVOD) is a rare but increasingly recognized cause of intestinal ischemia.

Given the more predictable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of low molecular weight heparins, their simpler (fixed) dosing regimens, and few or no laboratory monitoring requirements, low molecular weight heparins are gradually replacing heparin for the initial treatment of most patients diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism, except in very obese patients or patients with renal failure. Only selected patients with massive, life-threatening pulmonary embolism should be managed with intravenously administered thrombolytic drugs, surgical embolectomy, or catheter-based embolectomy. Likewise, inferior vena caval filter should be considered only in patients with an absolute contraindication to, or a documented failure of, anticoagulant therapy. New anticoagulants, such as ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, or fondaparinux and idraparinux, selective factor Xa inhibitors with an almost complete bioavailability after subcutaneous injection are promising alternatives, but these drugs have yet to find a place in the initial treatment of pulmonary embolism in standard day-to-day clinical practice. Long-term anticoagulation treatment is still provided by antivitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin), which unfortunately have a narrow therapeutic window. Consequently, time-consuming monitoring is required to ensure the therapeutic anticoagulant effect. A target International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.5 (INR range: 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended for warfarin therapy. This treatment should be continued for at least 3 months for patients with a first episode of pulmonary embolism secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, or up to 6 to 12 months for patients with a first episode of idiopathic pulmonary embolism.","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:05.250Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:05.250Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67739d4d83dcf45b36505b","title":"Medication Errors","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003495-200565130-00001","abstract":"In recent years medication error has justly received considerable attention, as it causes substantial mortality, morbidity and additional healthcare costs.

Recent publications provide insight into the role of the active transport systems P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and human organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) in drug interactions. Active drug transporters influence the bioavailability of a number of drugs by controlling their movement into, and out of, cells.The active transport systems P-gp and OATP play an important role in drug elimination. The activity of these transport systems is controlled, in part, by genetic factors; however, drugs and foods also influence the activity of these systems. It appears that interference with P-gp or OATP, either as upregulation or inhibition, may affect plasma drug concentrations by altering intestinal absorption, proximal renal-tubular excretion or biliary excretion. Overall, the net bioavailability of a drug or substance is affected by the relative contributions of cellular efflux (P-gp) and influx (OATP) mechanisms and to what extent these systems are active during phases of uptake and absorption versus removal and excretion from the body.Many of the drugs and foods that affect active drug transport activity are known to interact with the cytochrome P450 enzyme system; therefore, the net effect of concomitant drug administration is complex.

At present, there are two fundamental interventional choices: restoration and maintenance of normal sinus rhythm (NSR) or control of the ventricular rate. While there are compelling theoretical benefits in restoring and maintaining NSR, until recently there has been little evidence supporting the comparative advantages of either strategy. During the past few years, five randomised trials investigating the two treatment strategies have been completed: PIAF (Pharmacological Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation), STAF (Strategies of Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation), RACE (RAte Control versus Electrical conversion), AFFIRM (Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up of Rhythm Management) and HOT-CAFE (How to Treat Chronic Atrial Fibrillation). Results from these studies indicate that a strategy of rate control in AF patients can be at least as effective as efforts to control rhythm with respect to several specific outcomes. These trials have also revealed the necessity of continuing antithrombotic treatment even when long-term sinus rhythm is obtained. However, these trials had different patient selection criteria, endpoints and therapeutic interventions, limiting the applicability of their findings to all AF populations. This article looks beyond the primary results from these important studies, using recent substudy analyses to draw new conclusions and to generate hypotheses that will require prospective evaluation in adequately powered trials. One substudy suggested, for instance, that failure of rhythm control to show superiority may be a result of the toxicity of current antiarrhythmic drugs. New class III compounds with novel mechanisms are now in varying stages of clinical development. These drugs appear to block multiple membrane ion channels, with predominant effects on the atria and low proarrhythmic potential. It is anticipated that these agents will be safer than, and at least as effective as, currently available drugs, thereby reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Until more effective treatments are available, physicians should use the evidence generated from the major studies to guide decision making based upon the characteristics and symptomatic presentation of individual patients.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:05.250Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:05.250Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773a94d83dcf45b365061","title":"Approach to the Treatment-experienced patient","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11904-005-0023-5","abstract":"Failure of antiretroviral therapy can occur for a variety of reasons, but is often caused by or accompanied by drug resistance, which increases with continued time on nonsuppressive, failing regimens.

This has been especially true in the area of antiretroviral therapy where the assurance of adequate and sustained drug exposure of multiple agents is highly correlated with therapeutic success. Population pharmacokinetic analyses across the four drug classes and 20 US FDA-approved products used to treat HIV have been published to date. The published reports were predominantly based on actual clinical trials conducted in HIV-infected patients with one or more agents administered.Modelling and simulation approaches have been used in the evaluation of antiretroviral agent outcomes incorporating problematic design and analysis factors such as sparse plasma sampling, data imbalance and censored data. Additional benefits of population modelling approaches applied to the investigation of antiretroviral agents include the ability to assess dosing compliance, understanding and quantifying drug-drug interactions in order to select dosing regimens and the screening of new drug candidates. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models have been used to characterise the relationship between drug exposure and virological and immunological response, and to predict clinical outcome. These models offer the best opportunity for individualising and optimising patient therapy, particularly when adjusted for adherence/compliance.The impact of population pharmacokinetics in the area of antiretroviral therapy can be directly assessed by its role in the validation of surrogate markers such as viral RNA load, therapeutic drug monitoring and the management of individual patient outcomes via exposure-toxicity relationships.

In addition, the effects of food on the metabolite kinetics and pharmacodynamic responses, and the potential role of food effect in the modulation of oral biovariability and multidrug resistance have been extensively discussed. Overall, this comprehensive pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that a broad spectrum of food effects is seen among anticancer agents because of diverse factors regulating each drug’s oral bioavailability and its interactions with food. The consideration of such effects is important, as it could lead to more rational pharmacological monitoring and possibly improve the oral chemotherapy of cancer in children, adults and the elderly.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:29.431Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:29.431Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773b54d83dcf45b36507a","title":"Management of Gastrointestinal Disorders in Children with HIV Infection","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00148581-200406060-00003","abstract":"A double scenario characterizes the epidemiology of HIV infection in children. In countries where highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is available, the pattern of HIV infection is evolving into that of a chronic disease, for which control strictly depends on patients’ adherence to treatment. In developing countries with no or limited access to HAART, AIDS is rapidly expanding and is loaded with a high fatality ratio, due to the combined effects of malnutrition and opportunistic infections.The digestive tract is a target of the disease in both settings. Opportunistic infections play a major role in children with severe immune impairment, with Cryptosporidium parvum being the leading agent of severe diarrhea. Several therapeutic approaches are effective in reducing fecal output, but the eradication of the parasite is rarely obtained. Other opportunistic infections may induce severe and protracted diarrhea, including atypical mycobacteria and cytomegalovirus. Diagnosis of diarrhea should be individually tailored based on presenting symptoms and risk factors. A stepwise approach is effective in limiting patient discomfort and minimizing the costs of investigations, starting with microbiologic investigation and proceeding with endoscopy and histology. Aggressive treatment of infectious diarrhea is required in severely immunocompromised children. However, antiretroviral therapy prevents the development of severe cryptosporidiosis.The liver and pancreas are also target organs in HIV infection, although functional failure is rare. The digestive-absorptive functions are impaired, with steatorrhea, nutrient malabsorption, and increased permeability occurring in 20–70% of children. Intestinal dysfunction contributes to growth failure and further immune derangement, leading to wasting, the terminal stage of AIDS. Nutritional management is crucial in HIV-infected children and is based on aggressive nutritional rehabilitation through enteral or parenteral routes and micronutrient supplementation.HIV may play a direct enteropathogenic role and is implicated in both diarrhea and intestinal dysfunction. This explains the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy in inducing remission of diarrhea and restoring intestinal function.Gastrointestinal side effects of antiretroviral drugs are increasingly observed; they are often mild and transient. Severe reactions are rare but require the withdrawal of drugs.In conclusion, severe enteric infections and intestinal dysfunction characterize the intestinal involvement of HIV infection. This is more common in, but not limited to, children who do not receive effective antiretroviral therapy. Diagnostic approaches include microbiologic and morphologic examinations and assessment of digestive processes, but immunologic and virologic data should be also carefully considered. Treatment is based upon specific anti-infectious drugs, antiretroviral therapy, and nutritional rehabilitation.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:29.431Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:29.431Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773b94d83dcf45b36507b","title":"The allergy and immunology specialist","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1385/CRIAI%3A27%3A2%3A123","abstract":"The practice of medicine transcends our neat borders of demarcation between the myriad of medical specialties and medical disciplines.

Drugs most prominently affected and contraindicated for concomitant use with St John’s wort are metabolised via both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein pathways, including HIV protease inhibitors, HIV non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (only CYP3A4), the immunosuppressants ciclosporin and tacrolimus, and the antineoplastic agents irinotecan and imatinib mesylate.

Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored more closely when St John’s wort is added, discontinued or the dosage is changed. The St John’s wort constituent hyperforin is probably responsible for CYP3A4 induction via activation of a nuclear steroid/pregnane and xenobiotic receptor (SXR/PXR) and hypericin may be assumed to be the P-glycoprotein inducing compound, although the available evidence is less convincing.Combinations of St John’s wort with serotonergic agents and other antidepressants should be restricted to prescription-only, by experienced clinicians, due to potential central pharmacodynamic interactions.In conclusion, providing certain precautions and contraindications are followed, and adequate information is given to healthcare professionals and patients, the safe and effective use of quality-tested St John’s wort products can be ensured.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:33.322Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:33.322Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773b94d83dcf45b36507e","title":"Evaluation of patient chemotherapy education in a gynecology oncology center","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00520-003-0546-5","abstract":"To assess the level at which patient chemotherapy education needs are being met by the health-care team in an outpatient clinic setting and to identify any unmet needs regarding patient chemotherapy education.A questionnaire comprising 17 questions was developed to evaluate patient preferences regarding chemotherapy education.

New agents have been developed that act primarily to reduce postprandial glucose excursions, which may be of particular significance now that postprandial glucose excursions are known to be correlated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Nateglinide is a phenylalanine derivative that blocks K+ channels in pancreatic β-cells, facilitating insulin secretion. Nateglinide sensitises β-cells to ambient glucose, reducing the glucose concentration needed to stimulate insulin secretion. The pharmacokinetics of nateglinide are characterised by rapid absorption and elimination, with good (73%) bioavailability. Nateglinide is more rapidly absorbed when given 0–30 minutes prior to meal ingestion than if given during the meal. Nateglinide is extensively metabolised, primarily by cytochrome P450 2C9, and eliminated primarily by the kidney. Nateglinide pharmacokinetics are linear over the dose range 60–240mg. No significant pharmacokinetic alterations occur in renally impaired patients, in the elderly, or in mildly hepatically impaired patients.Nateglinide administered prior to meals stimulates rapid, short-lived insulin secretion in a dose-dependent manner, thus decreasing mealtime plasma glucose excursions. Its effects on insulin secretion are synergistic with those of a meal. With increasing nateglinide doses, the risk of hypoglycaemia also increases, but its incidence is low. Even if a meal is missed, and the patient skips the dose of nateglinide (as recommended in the event of a missed meal), the incidence of subsequent hypoglycaemia remains low compared with long-acting agents. The postprandial insulinotropic effects of nateglinide are more rapid than those of repaglinide and more rapid and greater than those of glibenclamide (glyburide), while producing less prolonged insulin exposure and less risk of delayed hypoglycaemia. Further investigation is required to determine if nateglinide inhibition of postprandial glucose excursions will help to prevent diabetic complications or preserve pancreatic β-cell function.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:33.322Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:33.322Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773cd4d83dcf45b365097","title":"Medikamentöse Therapie des Rückenschmerzes","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00132-003-0563-6","abstract":"Der Stellenwert der medikamentösen Therapie des Rückenschmerzes wird kontrovers diskutiert.

In infant leukemias, the chromosome translocations involvingMLL arise during fetal hematopoiesis, possibly in a primitive lymphomyeloid stem cell. In general, these leukemias have a very poor prognosis. The malignancy of these leukemias is all the more dramatic considering their very short preclinical natural history or latency.

The most clinically important drug interactions in dermatological practice are caused by alterations in drug metabolism. The contributions of P-glycoprotein, pharmacogenetic variation and genetic polymorphisms to drug interactions are highlighted, and the best evidence for drug interactions involving drug classes relevant to the dermatologist is presented.Since the initial evidence for clinically relevant drug interactions comes from case reports, prescribing physicians can have a major role in collating information on interactions.

Consequently, the administration of intravenous antimicrobials in a home or infusion clinic setting has now become commonplace. Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) is considered safe, therapeutically effective and economical. A broad range of infections can be successfully managed with OPAT, although this form of treatment is unnecessary when oral therapy can be used. Many antimicrobials can be employed for OPAT and the choice of agent(s) and regimen should be based upon sound clinical and microbiological evidence. Assessments of cost and convenience should be made subsequent to these primary treatment outcome determinants. When designing an OPAT treatment regimen, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the individual agents should also be considered.Pharmacokinetics (PK) is the study of the time course of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of drugs (what the body does to the drug). Clinical pharmacokinetic monitoring has been used to overcome the pharmacokinetic variability of antimicrobials and enable individualised dosing regimens that attain desirable antimicrobial serum concentrations. Pharmacodynamics (PD) is the study of the relationship between the serum concentration of a drug and the clinical response observed in a patient (what the drug does to the body). By combining pharmacokinetic properties (peak [Cmax] or trough [Cmin] serum concentrations, half-life, area under the curve) and pharmacodynamic properties (susceptibility results, minimum inhibitory concentrations [MIC] or minimum bactericidal concentrations [MBC], bactericidal or bacteriostatic killing, post-antibiotic effects), unique PK/PD parameters or indices (t > MIC, Cmax/MIC, AUC24/MIC) can be defined.Depending on the killing characteristics of a given class of antimicrobials (concentration-dependent or time-dependent), specific PK/PD parameters may predict in vitro bacterial eradication rates and correlate with in vivo microbiologic and clinical cures. An understanding of these principles will enable the clinician to vary dosing schemes and design individualised dosing regimens to achieve optimal PK/PD parameters and potentially improve patient outcomes. This paper will review basic principles of useful PK/PD parameters for various classes of antimicrobials as they may relate to OPAT.In summary, OPAT has become an important treatment option for the management of infectious diseases in the community setting. To optimise treatment course outcomes, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the individual agents should be carefully considered when designing OPAT treatment regimens.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:53.075Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:53.075Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773d24d83dcf45b36509f","title":"Serum Rifampicin Levels in Patients with Tuberculosis","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00044011-200323070-00005","abstract":" Objective: To identify patients with tuberculosis (TB) showing poor bioavailability for rifampicin and to delineate the role of possible factors such as overexpression of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (PGP) in the drug’s bioavailability by administering known blockers. Patients, design and setting: 77 clinically proven TB patients were included in this nonblinded, randomised, comparative trial carried out at one centre at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. Interventions: The concentrations of rifampicin and its active metabolite, 25-desacetylrifampicin (DRMP), were measured in blood samples of the 77 TB patients at 0, 1, 2 and 4 hours after their usual morning rifampicin dose. Of these, 19 patients showing the lowest area under the concentration-time curve values from 0 to 4 hours after administration (AUC0–4) were selected and pretreated with a single dose of either verapamil (80mg) or itraconazole (200mg) as both PGP and CYP3A4 blockers 1 hour prior to rifampicin administration. Rifampicin and DRMP concentrations were estimated using high performance liquid chromatography in all serum samples collected at the same timepoints.

Protease inhibitors (PIs) and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) efavirenz and nevirapine satisfy many criteria for TDM. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are not suitable candidates for TDM, since no clear plasma concentration-effect relationships have been established for these drugs.Several important limitations to the application of TDM for antiretroviral drugs should be recognised, including uncertainty about the best pharmacokinetic predictor of response and insufficient validation of target concentrations for individual PIs and NNRTIs. Data from two clinical trials support the use of TDM in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients who start with an indinavir- or nelfinavir-based regimen. TDM either prevented virological failures (presumably by preventing the development of resistance) or treatment discontinuations due to concentration-related toxicity. Application of routine TDM in other patient groups (treatment-experienced patients) or for drugs other than indinavir or nelfinavir (NNRTIs, other PIs, combination of PIs) is speculative at this moment. However, TDM can be used in selected patient groups (children, pregnant women, patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction) to confirm adequate drug concentrations, and for management of drug-drug interactions.TDM in treatment-experienced patients may be optimally used in conjunction with resistance testing. The integration of pharmacological and virological measures in the inhibitory quotient (IQ) needs to be standardised and elaborated further. TDM should be accompanied by careful assessment of adherence and can itself help identify non-adherence, although a drug concentration only reflects the last few drug doses taken by a patient. Additional clinical trials are needed before routine TDM can be adopted as standard of care in the treatment of HIV infection.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:58.167Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:22:58.167Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773d24d83dcf45b3650a2","title":"Epidemiology of anaphylaxis in the united states","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11882-003-0007-8","abstract":"Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction characterized by a syndrome of dermatologic and systemic signs and symptoms, at times including cardiovascular collapse from distributive shock.

Situations that qualify as hypertensive emergencies include accelerated or malignant hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy, acute left ventricular failure, acute aortic dissection, pheochromocytoma crisis, interaction between tyramine-containing foods or drugs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, eclampsia, drug-induced hypertension and possibly intracranial hemorrhage. It is important to recognize these conditions since immediate lowering of systemic blood pressure is indicated. The diagnosis of hypertensive emergencies depends on the clinical manifestations rather than on the absolute level of the blood pressure. Depending on the target organ that is affected, the manifestations of hypertensive emergencies can be quite expressive, yet variable. Thus, the physician has to make the clinical diagnosis urgently in order to render appropriate therapy. Several parenteral drugs can quickly and effectively lower the blood pressure in hypertensive emergencies. Intravenous fenoldopam, a selective dopamine (DA1) receptor agonist, offers the advantage of improving renal blood flow and causing natriuresis. Intravenous nicardipine may be beneficial in reserving tissue perfusion in patients with ischemic disorders. Whereas trimethaphan camsilate is the drug of choice for managing acute aortic dissection, hydralazine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of eclampsia. The α-adrenoceptor, phentolamine, is useful in patients with pheochromocytoma crisis. Enalaprilat is the only ACE inhibitor available for parenteral use and may be particularly useful in treating hypertensive emergencies in patients with heart failure. However, ACE inhibitors may cause a precipitous fall in blood pressure in patients who are hypovolemic. Although useful as adjunctive therapy in hypertensive crises, diuretics should be used with caution in these patients because prior volume depletion may be present in some conditions such as malignant hypertension. The treating physician should be familiar with the pharmacological and clinical actions of drugs which are indicated for and useful in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. Once the patient’s situation has stabilized, the patient may be switched to an oral medication and the physician should discuss long term follow up plans.

The real risk of antibiotic use while breast-feeding must be carefully analysed with regard to all the variables that influence the extent of antibiotic distribution into breast milk, including breast milk composition, physicochemical properties of the antibiotic (molecular weight, lipid solubility, pH, protein binding), length of feeding, and maternal disposition. In addition, infant disposition, including ability to absorb, metabolize, eliminate, and tolerate any amounts of antibiotic, must also be considered prior to maternal administration of antibiotic. The milk to plasma (M/P) ratio is a frequently quoted parameter used to predict drug distribution into breast milk. However, its utility is questionable and often fraught with misinterpretation. An alternative approach when the amount of antibiotic concentration in breast milk is known (through clinical trials) is to calculate an estimated or expected infant drug exposure factoring in known/expected milk consumption, drug concentration and bioavailability. In this review, the following antibiotic classes and current literature regarding their distribution into breast milk are critically reviewed: β-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, macrolides, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, metronidazole, vancomycin, clindamycin and chloramphenicol. In the majority of instances, these antibiotics do not distribute into breast milk in sufficient concentrations to be of any clinical consequence in the breast-feeding infant.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:07.755Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:07.755Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773db4d83dcf45b3650aa","title":"Comparative Tolerability of Contrast Media Used for Coronary Interventions","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00002018-200225150-00003","abstract":"Radiographic contrast media (CM) are necessary to provide x-ray absorption of the bloodstream; all other observed effects need to be regarded as adverse. Four types of CM are currently used in diagnostic and interventional cardiology: ionic high-osmolar CM (HOCM), either ionic or non-ionic low-osmolar CM (LOCM), and non-ionic iso-osmolar CM (IOCM). Focusing on the potential cardiovascular effects caused by the CM, there is a clear difference between HOCM and the LOCM or IOCM. HOCM have a poorer profile due to a higher incidence of hypotension and electrophysiological effects. To prevent contrast-induced nephropathy, HOCM should be avoided and patients should receive the minimal dose of LOCM or IOCM with intravenous hydration before and after the procedure. Clinical hyperthyroidism has been detected after CM use, but the condition appears, ultimately, to be self-limited and to occur mainly in elderly patients. When assessing the need for a CM in terms of improved patient safety, preventing serious complications should be the major factor determining the choice. CM should not be selected on the basis of minor adverse effects since these are, ultimately, of low clinical relevance. Thrombotic events, in contrast, carry a high clinical relevance and we consider that these should be the main issue governing current choice. Ionic LOCM appear to have better profile than other CM with respect to interaction with platelet function and coagulation. In relation to thrombotic events in randomised clinical studies, ionic CM have been associated, mainly, with favourable and some neutral results compared with non-ionic agents. Only one trial indicated a more pronounced antithrombotic effect of the non-ionic IOCM relative to the ionic LOCM. The antithrombotic advantages of ionic over non-ionic LOCM are, in part, balanced by a greater frequency of minor adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting or cutaneous rashes. A matter of concern is the delayed adverse effects observed with non-ionic IOCM. However, severe and life-threatening reactions are exceptional and there are probably no significant differences between IOCM and LOCM whether ionic or non-ionic. However, in patients with known allergies, non-ionic CM are to be recommended. On the basis of the available pre-clinical and clinical data, the ionic LOCM or the non-ionic IOCM are the agents to be recommended in percutaneous coronary interventions because of their antithrombotic advantages over non-ionic LOCM.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:07.755Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:07.755Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773db4d83dcf45b3650ad","title":"Supplementierungsmedikamente beim Einsatz der Larynxmaske in der Kataraktchirurgie","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00347-002-0655-4","abstract":" Hintergrund.

Items that considered the patient's perspective were commonly suggested, but many were discarded after discussing their operationalisation. Consensus was obtained that eighteen items, in seven domains, should be included in the instrument.

The majority of clinically relevant food-drug interactions are caused by food-induced changes in the bioavailability of the drug. Since the bioavailability and clinical effect of most drugs are correlated, the bioavailability is an important pharmacokinetic effect parameter. However, in order to evaluate the clinical relevance of a food-drug interaction, the impact of food intake on the clinical effect of the drug has to be quantified as well. As a result of quality review in healthcare systems, healthcare providers are increasingly required to develop methods for identifying and preventing adverse food-drug interactions. In this review of original literature, we have tried to provide both pharmacokinetic and clinical effect parameters of clinically relevant food-drug interactions.The most important interactions are those associated with a high risk of treatment failure arising from a significantly reduced bioavailability in the fed state. Such interactions are frequently caused by chelation with components in food (as occurs with alendronic acid, clodronic acid, didanosine, etidronic acid, penicillamine and tetracycline) or dairy products (ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin), or by other direct interactions between the drug and certain food components (avitriptan, indinavir, itraconazole solution, levodopa, melphalan, mercaptopurine and perindopril). In addition, the physiological response to food intake, in particular gastric acid secretion, may reduce the bioavailability of certain drugs (ampicillin, azithromycin capsules, didanosine, erythromycin stearate or enteric coated, and isoniazid). For other drugs, concomitant food intake may result in an increase in drug bioavailability either because of a food-induced increase in drug solubility (albendazole, atovaquone, griseofulvin, isotretinoin, lovastatin, mefloquine, saquinavir and tacrolimus) or because of the secretion of gastric acid (itraconazole capsules) or bile (griseofulvin and halofantrine) in response to food intake. For most drugs, such an increase results in a desired increase in drug effect, but in others it may result in serious toxicity (halofantrine).","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:11.737Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:11.737Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773df4d83dcf45b3650b3","title":"Grapefruit Juice Reduces the Oral Bioavailability of Fexofenadine But Not Desloratadine","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003088-200241040-00004","abstract":"Certain foods, such as grapefruit juice, are known to substantially alter the bioavailability of some drugs.

However, using modern techniques of water purification, such acute intoxication can now be avoided.Dialysis-associated encephalopathy/dementia (DAE) is always associated with elevated serum aluminium levels. Pathognomonic morphological changes in the brain have been described, but the mechanism for the entry of aluminium into the CNS is incompletely understood. The mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the neurotoxicity associated with aluminium are numerous. Although only a very small fraction of ingested aluminium is absorbed, the continuous oral aluminium intake from aluminium-based phosphate binders, and also of dietary or environmental origin, is responsible for aluminium overload in dialysis patients.Age-related dementia, especially vascular dementia, occurs in patients undergoing long-term dialysis as frequently as it does in the general population.The differential diagnoses of dialysis-associated dementias should include investigation for metabolic encephalopathies, heavy metal or trace element intoxications, and distinct structural neurological lesions such as subdural haematoma, normal pressure hydrocephalus, stroke and, particularly, hypertensive encephalopathy and multi-infarct dementia.To prevent DAE, dietary training programmes should aim to achieve the lowest phosphate intake and pharmacological tools should be used to keep serum phosphate levels below 2 mmol/L.

Despite the lack of definitive evidence of the efficacy of these agents in this setting, over the past decade this intervention has become the standard of care for healthcare workers who sustain occupational exposures to HIV.Administration of these agents — even for a relatively short 28-day postexposure course — is often fraught with difficulty. All of the agents currently used for postexposure prophylaxis regimens have substantial adverse effects, and significant adverse effects occur in more than two-thirds of individuals electing prophylaxis. This manuscript reiterates current US Federal Government guidelines for the administration of postexposure prophylaxis, specifically noting that zidovudine plus lamivudine (with or without a protease inhibitor) remains the recommended regimen. The paper summarises the significant toxicities associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (primarily nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bone marrow suppression), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (rash, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and hepatitis, including hepatic decompensation necessitating liver transplantation) and protease inhibitors (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, headache and anorexia).As a class, the antiretroviral agents have an extraordinary number of drug interactions. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the protease inhibitors are metabolised through the cytochrome P450 pathway, and the effects of concomitant administration of protease inhibitors with other agents in the same class are discussed, as well as the effects of concomitant administration of protease inhibitors with non-nucleoside agents. The potential for numerous and medically risky drug interactions emphasises the importance of planning antiretroviral prophylaxis in consultation with practitioners or clinical pharmacists who are skilled in the use of these agents and knowledgeable about the potential for significant drug interactions that could either reduce the benefit of prophylaxis or increase the potential for toxicity.Another common problem encountered by individuals managing postexposure prophylaxis programmes relates to the administration of chemoprophylaxis to a pregnant healthcare worker who has sustained an occupational exposure to HIV.

Based on their predominant renal elimination, dosage adjustment is necessary in the presence of renal disease for Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and sitafloxacin.Drug interactions, particularly with multivalent cations (calcium/aluminium-containing antacids and iron products), remain a problem for the newer agents, resulting in reduced absorption requiring separate administration times to maximise bioavailability. However, the newer agents do not appear to interfere significantly with the cytochrome P450 system, thus minimising the potential for interactions with other drugs metabolised by this system.The pharmacodynamic properties of the fluoroquinolones have been well described. The bactericidal activity is maximised when the ratios of peak plasma drug concentration (Cmax) : minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) or area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) : MIC exceed specific threshold values. Knowledge of the pharmacodynamic relationships allows for appropriate drug selection and enables design of dosage regimens to maximise the bactericidal activity. Therapeutic drug monitoring of the fluoroquinolones may provide a means of optimising the dosage regimen in certain clinical situations (that is, meningitis and hospitalised pneumonias) with the goals of achieving a more predictable therapeutic response and minimising the potential for the development of resistance.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:21.949Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:21.949Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773e94d83dcf45b3650c9","title":"Can we induce tolerance in rheumatoid arthritis?","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11926-001-0052-z","abstract":"Oral tolerance (OT) has worked well in numerous laboratory animal models of autoimmune diseases.

Venlafaxine extended-release (XR) has been investigated in patients with major depression and in patients with major depression with associated anxiety in randomised, double-blind, multicentre trials. A therapeutic response in patients with major depression was evident at week 2 of treatment with venlafaxine XR 75 to 225 mg/day in a placebo-controlled trial. By week 4, the drug was significantly more effective than placebo at reducing both the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores. Furthermore, cumulative relapse rates were lower among recipients of venlafaxine XR 75 to 225 mg/day than placebo recipients after 3 and 6 months in another trial. Venlafaxine XR 75 to 150 mg/day was significantly more effective than venlafaxine immediate-release (IR) 75 to 150 mg/day or placebo during a 12-week study. Reductions from baseline in all 4 efficacy parameters (HAM-D, MADRS, HAM-D depressed mood item and the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness scale) were significantly higher among patients treated with venlafaxine XR than venlafaxine IR or placebo at week 12 (using an intent-to-treat, last observation carried forward analysis)Venlafaxine XR 75 to 225 mg/day was compared with fluoxetine 20 to 60 mg/day in patients with major depression in 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies. Remission rates were significantly in favour of venlafaxine XR recipients in one study: 37, 22 and 18% of patients treated with venlafaxine XR, fluoxetine or placebo, respectively, achieved full remission (HAM-D total score ≤7 at end-point). In the other trial, venlafaxine XR and fluoxetine had comparable efficacy in reducing HAM-D and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total scores compared with placebo. However, the HAM-A response rate was significantly higher with venlafaxine XR than with fluoxetine at week 12.In a comparative study involving paroxetine, reductions from baseline in HAM-D and MADRS total scores in patients given venlafaxine XR 75 mg/day or paroxetine 20 mg/day for 12 weeks were significant, but no significant differences between treatment groups were evident.Discontinuation rates because of unsatisfactory clinical response were similar among patients treated with venlafaxine XR, fluoxetine or paroxetine.Adverse events pertaining to the digestive (nausea, dry mouth), nervous (dizziness, somnolence, insomnia) and urogenital (abnormal ejaculation) systems as well as sweating were the most frequently reported adverse events during 8 to 12 weeks of treatment in 3 randomised, double-blind, multicentre trials. Comparative studies with fluoxetine and paroxetine demonstrated a similar adverse event profile to venlafaxine XR. Conclusion: Venlafaxine XR has shown efficacy in the treatment of major depression and was at least as effective as fluoxetine or paroxetine and more effective than venlafaxine IR. Furthermore, it is effective at reducing symptoms of anxiety in depressed patients. The incidence of adverse events in recipients of venlafaxine XR is similar to that in patients receiving treatment with well established selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. As an effective and well tolerated antidepressant, venlafaxine XR should be considered as a first-line pharmacological treatment in patients with major depression.Venlafaxine and its major active metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) both inhibit presynaptic reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine). Venlafaxine has been referred to previously as a serotonin noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Venlafaxine also weakly inhibits dopamine reuptake. The drug has no significant affinity for α1-adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic, H1 histaminergic, benzodiazepine or opioid receptors and does not inhibit monoamine oxidase.Venlafaxine 75 to 150 mg/day did not impair psychomotor performance to any clinically significant degree in healthy volunteers. Although the drug impaired vigilance, it did not affect driving ability after administration of 75 to 150 mg/day for 2 weeks. Venlafaxine did not exacerbate the detrimental effects on psychomotor performance when coadministered with diazepam or alcohol. However, the drug markedly suppressed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increased wake time in healthy volunteers and patients with depression.Although dosages ≤300 mg/day are not associated with a significant risk of sustained diastolic blood pressure (DBP) elevation, venlafaxine extended-release (XR) may elevate BP in some patients.The absolute bioavailability of venlafaxine XR (≈45%) is not affected by food or the time of administration, and plasma concentrations of the drug are not affected by gender or age. Maximum plasma concentrations of venlafaxine and ODV occur approximately 5.5 and 9 hours, respectively, after administration of venlafaxine XR, and steady-state concentrations are reached within 3 days with ongoing administration. Proportionality between the dose and plasma concentrations of venlafaxine has been demonstrated. Plasma protein binding is minimal for venlafaxine (27%) and ODV (30%).Venlafaxine undergoes extensive cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6-mediated first-pass oxidative metabolism to produce ODV. In most individuals, plasma concentrations of ODV are approximately 2- to 3-fold higher than those of the parent drug; in poor metabolisers (determined by genetic polymorphism in CYP2D6 activity), venlafaxine concentrations are higher than ODV concentrations.The terminal elimination half-lives of venlafaxine and ODV are 5 and 11 hours, respectively, and within 48 hours of administration, 87% of a dose of venlafaxine is recovered in urine.Clearance of venlafaxine is reduced and dosage adjustments are warranted in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, in those undergoing haemodialysis and in patients with hepatic cirrhosis.The results of in vitro and volunteer studies suggest that venlafaxine has a low potential to interfere with the metabolism of other drugs. However, concomitant administration of venlafaxine and diphenhydramine in 9 healthy volunteers with the CYP2D6 extensive metaboliser phenotype resulted in the oral clearance of venlafaxine being decreased by 59% and a more than 2-fold increase in the area under the concentration-time curve. Cimetidine also inhibited the metabolism of venlafaxine, but not ODV, in healthy volunteers; however, the interaction may not be of clinical significance.The clinical potential of venlafaxine XR, administered once daily, has been investigated in patients with major depression and in patients with major depression with associated anxiety, as defined by DSM-IV or DSM-III-R criteria, in randomised, double-blind, multicentre trials. All studies used an intent-to-treat, last observation carried forward analysis to determine efficacy.Venlafaxine XR 75 to 225 mg/day produced consistent and significant reductions in all primary outcome measures compared with placebo during an 8-week flexible dose study in patients with major depression. A therapeutic response was evident after 2 weeks of treatment with the drug. By week 4, venlafaxine XR was significantly more effective than placebo at reducing both the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores. Significantly fewer venlafaxine XR-treated patients discontinued treatment because of lack of therapeutic response than placebo recipients.Venlafaxine XR 75 to 150 mg/day was significantly more effective than venlafaxine immediate-release (IR) 75 to 150 mg/day or placebo during a 12-week flexible dose study. Reductions from baseline in HAM-D total and Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) rating scores were significantly higher among patients treated with venlafaxine XR than venlafaxine IR at week 8. A therapeutic response to venlafaxine XR compared with that to placebo was evident after 2 weeks with respect to reductions in HAM-D total scores and the HAM-D depressed mood item. Furthermore, mean reductions in all primary efficacy variables [HAM-D and MADRS total scores, HAM-D depressed mood item and the CGI-S] were significantly greater among recipients of venlafaxine XR than venlafaxine IR or placebo at week 12.In a subanalysis of the 2 aforementioned flexible dose studies, venlafaxine XR 75 to 150 mg/day significantly reduced HAM-D psychic anxiety scores compared with placebo. Apooled analysis of both studies involving the HAM-D item scores from the anxiety somatisation cluster (psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, somatic gastrointestinal and somatic general items) showed that mean score reductions were significantly higher in patients who received venlafaxine XR than placebo or venlafaxine IR at week 12.Venlafaxine XR has been compared with fluoxetine and placebo in patients with major depression in 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre studies. In an 8-week study, reductions in HAM-D total scores among patients treated with venlafaxine XR 75 to 225 mg/day or fluoxetine 20 to 60 mg/day were not significantly different to those in placebo recipients. However, whereas venlafaxine XR significantly reduced the MADRS, CGI-S and HAM-D depressed mood scores compared with placebo, fluoxetine significantly reduced only the HAM-D depressed mood item compared with placebo. Remission rates were significantly in favour of venlafaxine XR recipients: 37, 22 and 18% of patients treated with venlafaxine XR, fluoxetine or placebo, respectively, achieved full remission (HAM-D total score ≤7 at end-point). Furthermore, in a 12-week flexible dose study in patients with major depression and associated anxiety, venlafaxine XR and fluoxetine both significantly reduced HAM-D and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total scores compared with placebo. There were no significant differences between active treatment groups in any of the measured parameters (total scores of the HAM-D, HAM-A, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Covi Scale or remission rates). However, the HAM-A response rate was significantly higher (p < 0.05) with venlafaxine XR than with fluoxetine at week 12. Reductions in HAM-A total scores in venlafaxine XR recipients were significantly greater than those in placebo recipients after 8 weeks. Among recipients of fluoxetine, HAM-A total score reductions were higher than those of patients given placebo only at week 12. Both venlafaxine XR and fluoxetine significantly reduced HAM-D total scores compared with baseline values from week 2 to week 12.In the comparative study involving paroxetine, reductions from baseline in HAM-D and MADRS total scores in patients given venlafaxine XR 75 mg/day or paroxetine 20 mg/day for 12 weeks were both significant, but no significant differences between treatment groups were evident. Similarly, there were no significant between-group differences in response rates based on HAM-D, MADRS or Clinical Global Impression Global Improvement (CGI-I) scales, or in the number of patients achieving remission (defined as a HAM-D score of <7).Discontinuation rates because of unsatisfactory clinical response were similar among patients treated with venlafaxine XR, fluoxetine or paroxetine.According to the results from 2 meta-analyses, venlafaxine XR is associated with a significantly higher mean success rate than the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine or citalopram, or the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine or nortriptyline. A retrospective pooled analysis also demonstrated significantly higher rates of remission and absence of depressed mood in recipients of venlafaxine compared with paroxetine. However, it was not specified whether patients received venlafaxine XR or IR.A pharmacoeconomic analysis based on the results from one of these meta-analyses concluded that venlafaxine XR is the most cost-effective antidepressant for the initial treatment of major depression in both inpatients and outpatients.Among venlafaxine XR recipients, adverse events pertaining to the digestive (nausea, dry mouth), nervous (dizziness, somnolence, insomnia) and urogenital (abnormal ejaculation) systems as well as sweating were the most frequently reported adverse events during 8 to 12 weeks of treatment in 3 randomised, double-blind, multicentre trials.The proportion of patients withdrawing from these studies because of adverse effects was approximately 11 and 6% in patients receiving venlafaxine XR and placebo, respectively. Nausea (4 vs <1%), dizziness (2 vs 1%) and somnolence (2 vs <1%) were the most common events that resulted in discontinuation of treatment among patients in the 3 studies.The frequency of nausea associated with venlafaxine XR was highest during the first week of treatment and decreased thereafter.In one comparative study, dizziness and sweating were reported by a greater proportion of venlafaxine XR recipients (38 and 28% of patients, respectively) than those receiving fluoxetine (18 and 17%), whereas in another study, dizziness and nausea were more prevalent in venlafaxine XR recipients (26 and 36%) than those receiving fluoxetine (6 and 20%). There were no significant between-group differences in adverse events among patients receiving venlafaxine XR or paroxetine, although the mean duration of nausea was twice as long in paroxetine-treated patients (10 days) than in patients treated with venlafaxine XR (5 days).Venlafaxine can cause some cardiovascular effects in overdose but is markedly less hazardous than the TCAs. Two patients with depression who took overdoses of the drug during clinical trials recovered without serious complication. Nonetheless, the manufacturer advises that fatalities have been reported in patients taking overdoses of venlafaxine, predominantly in combination with alcohol or other drugs. Serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients receiving venlafaxine concomitantly or within ≤16 days of discontinuation of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. This combination is contraindicated. Serotonin syndrome has also been seen in patients taking venlafaxine alone, although rarely.Venlafaxine XR is indicated for the treatment of depression as defined by DSM-IV criteria. The recommended initial dosage of the drug in patients with depression is 75mg once daily, taken with food at the same time each day. In patients who do not improve with 75 mg/day, the dosage may be titrated in increments of ≤75 mg/day, at intervals of ≥4 days, to a maximum dosage of 225 mg/day. Venlafaxine XR has recently been approved for the prevention of relapse and the prevention of recurrence of depression. Although the optimum duration of treatment in patients with depression has not been determined, international guidelines recommended that, following remission, patients receive venlafaxine XR therapy for 16 to 20 weeks. The manufacturer recommends regular BP monitoring during treatment. Dosage adjustments are not required in elderly patients, but are necessary in those with renal or hepatic dysfunction. When discontinuing venlafaxine XR after more than 1 week’s treatment, the manufacturer recommends that the dosage be tapered in order to minimise the risk of discontinuation symptoms, which include asthenia, dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea and nervousness.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:21.949Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:21.949Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773e94d83dcf45b3650c8","title":"Clinical Psychology in India","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1011371705533","abstract":"Scientific Psychology in India has seen steady development since its inception in the early 1900s.

Because of its enormous popularity, the consumption of caffeine is generally thought to be safe and long term caffeine intake may be disregarded as a medical problem. However, it is clear that this compound has many of the features usually associated with a drug of abuse. Furthermore, physicians should be aware of the possible contribution of dietary caffeine to the presenting signs and symptoms of patients.The toxic effects of caffeine are extensions of their pharmacological effects. The most serious caffeine-related CNS effects include seizures and delirium. Other symptoms affecting the cardiovascular system range from moderate increases in heart rate to more severe cardiac arrhythmia. Although tolerance develops to many of the pharmacological effects of caffeine, tolerance may be overwhelmed by the nonlinear accumulation of caffeine when its metabolism becomes saturated. This might occur with high levels of consumption or as the result of a pharmacokinetic interaction between caffeine and over-the-counter or prescription medications.The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 participates in the metabolism of caffeine as well as of a number of clinically important drugs. A number of drugs, including certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (particularly fluvoxamine), antiarrhythmics (mexiletine), antipsychotics (clozapine), psoralens, idrocilamide and phenylpropanolamine, bronchodilators (furafylline and theophylline) and quinolones (enoxacin), have been reported to be potent inhibitors of this isoenzyme. This has important clinical implications, since drugs that are metabolised by, or bind to, the same CYP enzyme have a high potential for pharmacokinetic interactions due to inhibition of drug metabolism. Thus, pharmacokinetic interactions at the CYP1A2 enzyme level may cause toxic effects during concomitant administration of caffeine and certain drugs used for cardiovascular, CNS (an excessive dietary intake of caffeine has also been observed in psychiatric patients), gastrointestinal, infectious, respiratory and skin disorders. Unless a lack of interaction has already been demonstrated for the potentially interacting drug, dietary caffeine intake should be considered when planning, or assessing response to, drug therapy.Some of the reported interactions of caffeine, irrespective of clinical relevance, might inadvertently cause athletes to exceed the urinary caffeine concentration limit set by sports authorities at 12 mg/L. Finally, caffeine is a useful and reliable probe drug for the assessment of CYP1A2 activity, which is of considerable interest for metabolic studies in human populations.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:33.409Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:33.409Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773f54d83dcf45b3650d7","title":"Antithrombotic Therapy in Non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00044011-200019060-00003","abstract":" Background: Unstable angina and non-Q-wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are the most frequent causes of admission to the intensive care unit.

The pharmacokinetic advantages that clarithromycin has over erythromycin include increased oral bioavailability (52 to 55%), increased plasma concentrations (mean maximum concentrations ranged from 1.01 to 1.52 mg/L and 2.41 to 2.85 mg/L after multiple 250 and 500mg doses, respectively), and a longer elimination half-life (3.3 to 4.9 hours) to allow twice daily administration. In addition, clarithromycin has extensive diffusion into saliva, sputum, lung tissue, epithelial lining fluid, alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, tonsils, nasal mucosa and middle ear fluid.Clarithromycin is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A isozymes and has an active metabolite, 14-hydroxyclarithromycin. The reported mean values of total body clearance and renal clearance in adults have ranged from 29.2 to 58.1 L/h and 6.7 to 12.8 L/h, respectively. In patients with severe renal impairment, increased plasma concentrations and a prolonged elimination half-life for clarithromycin and its metabolite have been reported. A dosage adjustment for clarithromycin should be considered in patients with a creatinine clearance <1.8 L/h.The recommended goal for dosage regimens of clarithromycin is to ensure that the time that unbound drug concentrations in the blood remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration is at least 40 to 60% of the dosage interval. However, the concentrations and in vitro activity of 14-hydroxyclarithromycin must be considered for pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae. In addition, clarithromycin achieves significantly higher drug concentrations in the epithelial lining fluid and alveolar macrophages, the potential sites of extracellular and intracellular respiratory tract pathogens, respectively. Further studies are needed to determine the importance of these concentrations of clarithromycin at the site of infection.Clarithromycin can increase the steady-state concentrations of drugs that are primarily depend upon CYP3A metabolism (e.g., astemidole, cisapride, pimozide, midazolam and triazolam). This can be clinically important for drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index, such as carbamazepine, cyclosporin, digoxin, theophylline and warfarin. Potent inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., omeprazole and ritonavir) may also alter the metabolism of clarithromycin and its metabolites. Rifampicin (rifampin) and rifabutin are potent enzyme inducers and several small studies have suggested that these agents may significantly decrease serum clarithromycin concentrations. Overall, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies suggest that fewer serious drug interactions occur with clarithromycin compared with older macrolides such as erythromycin and troleandomycin.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:40.145Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:40.145Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6773fc4d83dcf45b3650e5","title":"Treatment of Tuberculous Infection and Disease in Children","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00128072-199901040-00006","abstract":"The standard preventive therapy for paediatric patients with tuberculous infection centres on isoniazid therapy.

The various phases in which food may interact with a coadministered drug are: (i) before and during gastrointestinal absorption; (ii) during distribution; (iii) during metabolism; and (iv) during elimination. Absorption and metabolism are the phases where food has most effect, and this review will focus on those areas. It will also review the variable and complex effects of antacids and metal ions on drug absorption.Mechanisms related to food effects on drug absorption have been described under 5 categories: those causing decreased, delayed, increased or accelerated absorption, and those in which food has no significant effect. Among the major variables that interface between differential effects of food and postprandial bioavailability are: (i) the physicochemical characteristics and enantiomorphic composition of the drug; (ii) timing of meals in relation to time of drug administration; (iii) size and composition of meals (especially fat, protein and fibre); and (iv) dose size. However, the influence of food is largely a matter of the design of the pharmaceutical formulation. In addition, the mechanism of ‘food effect’ may involve physiological and sensory responses to food, such as changes in gastrointestinal milieu and gastric emptying rate, reflex action, and may also involve the site and route (either portal or lymphatic) of drug absorption.Mixing drugs with fruit juice, such as grapefruit and orange juice, and acidic beverages, such as commercial soft drinks, may affect absorption because of decreases in gastric pH, which could offer a therapeutic advantage in certain clinical conditions, such as patients with HIV disease and cancer. The increased bioavailability caused by the concomitant intake of grapefruit juice results from the inhibition of intestinal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, but not hepatic CYP3A4 or colon CYP3A5, which probably involves the bioflavonoid naringenin and furanocoumarins.Although there is a vast amount of literature, there is still no rational scientific basis to predict the effect of food for a particular chemical entity or a chemical class of therapeutic agents. A mechanistic understanding of the effects of food may serve as a key to the pharmacokinetic optimisation of patient therapy, both in outpatients and hospitalised patients of various age groups.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:40.145Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:40.145Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774004d83dcf45b3650e7","title":"Allergie affections of the larynx in children-a clinico pathological study","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02996530","abstract":"Laryngeal manifestation of allergy though less common than, Rhinosinusitis, tubotympanitis and bronchopulmanary allergy but it is not that uncommon which is usually misdiagnosed and mistreated in children.

Besides the therapeutic quality of HDFs, the available information and the way in which this is presented are key factors in HDFs' success or failure to influence prescribing behaviour and enhance prescribing quality. This research evaluates the technical features and organisational information of Dutch HDFs. Methods: Seventy‐two (75%) of all Dutch HDFs were evaluated based on criteria retrieved from international literature and additional criteria drafted by occupational groups working with HDFs. Aspects that were studied were physical appearance and layout, practicability with respect to the available information and how easily this could be retrieved from the HDFs, information regarding drug choice policies such as seamless care, and the available type of therapeutic and pharmaceutical information. Results: Thirty‐three (46%) of the HDFs were less than 3 years old. Physical appearance of all HDFs was very well looked after. Two (3%) HDFs were disease‐oriented rather than drug‐oriented. Changes from pre‐admission therapy were addressed in 30 (42%) of the HDFs, but other seamless care policies were addressed in less than 20% of the HDFs. Finally, less than 50% provided therapeutic information that clinicians indicated as important. Discussion: Although Dutch HDFs are technically practicable with respect to user‐convenience, practice‐oriented features are capable of improvements. Furthermore, Dutch HDFs lack important clinical information for daily practice. To enhance seamless care across healthcare, generic prescribing and prescribing on admission from and discharge to any other sectors should be addressed more specifically.","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:44.090Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:44.090Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774004d83dcf45b3650e9","title":"Comparative Tolerability of Second Generation Antihistamines","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00002018-199920050-00001","abstract":"Second generation histamine H1 receptor antagonists, the so-called ‘nonsedating’ antihistamines, have high potency and additional antiallergic properties as well as H1 antagonism and are associated with fewer adverse effects compared with the first generation antihistamines. A number of drugs in this class are approved for use: acrivastine, astemizole, azelastine, cetirizine, ebastine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine and terfenadine. All of them have a more favourable risk-benefit ratio with regard to the CNS adverse effects. Even those second generation antihistamines that are not actually ‘nonsedating’ are less impairing than their predecessors, but not one of them is entirely devoid of CNS activity.Under certain circumstances some antihistamines may affect cardiac repolarisation resulting in cardiovascular adverse effects. Serious cardiovascular effects have been reported with terfenadine and astemizole when they are used in high dosages or when they are given to ‘at risk’ patients. Animal models indicate that there might be a potential risk of cardiovascular adverse effects with other antihistamines as well. However, up to now there is no clinical evidence for this assumption, despite some confusing reports. Likewise there has been much discussion about a link between these agents and carcinogenicity. However, there is no evidence that any of the second generation antihistamines increase the risk of tumour growth in humans.Small children, elderly patients and persons with chronic renal or liver impairment are special groups in which the individual adverse effects of the second generation antihistamines must be kept in mind. The dosage for an individual has to be modified with respect to their metabolic situation.Despite the fact that some of the second generation antihistamines are listed in the US Food and Drug Administration pregnancy risk classification as class B, the use of second generation antihistamines should be avoided during pregnancy and they should never be administered to nursing mothers.Taking into account their negligible CNS activity, the low incidence of cardiovascular adverse effects, their lack of anticholinergic effects and other benefits, this class of antiallergic drugs represents a definite advance in therapy.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:44.090Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:44.090Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774004d83dcf45b3650eb","title":"Initiation of Warfarin Therapy: Recommendations and Clinical Pearls","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1008833520158","abstract":"Warfarin is a commonly used medication with a narrow therapeutic index.

These processes are put in the context of drug and formulation physicochemical properties and oral input influences on variable GI physiology. Interaction categorisation makes use of a biopharmaceutical classification system based on drug aqueous solubility and membrane permeability and their contributions towards absorption variability. Overlaying this classification it is important to be aware of the effect that the magnitudes of drug dosage and volume of fluid administration can have on interactions involving a solubility rate limits.GI regional differences in membrane permeability are fundamental to the rational development of extended release dosage forms as well as to predicting interaction effects on absorption from immediate release dosage forms. The effect of meals on the regional-dependent intestinal elimination of drugs and their involvement in drug absorption interactions is also discussed. Although the clinical significance of such interactions is certainly dependent on the narrowness of the drug therapeutic index, clinical aspects of absorption delays and therapeutic failures resulting from various interactions are also important.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:44.090Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:44.090Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774004d83dcf45b3650ef","title":"The Internet and Drug Safety","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00002018-199920020-00001","abstract":"Use of the Internet is becoming widespread throughout the world. Its use in the domain of drug safety and pharmacovigilance is spreading rapidly. Governments and industry have taken the lead in developing extensive web sites. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) and other agencies have developed sites containing enormous amounts of information both on pharmacovigilance in general and on specific drugs in particular. Under the US ‘Freedom of Information Act’ the FDA has put major parts of its adverse event database on line. Regulatory documents are also available from the FDA site or from hyperlinks described in the site. The US Center for Drug Evaluation and Research updates its site most days and maintains a free automated e-mail announcement service of these updates. Similarly, the EMEA updates its site frequently and publishes extensive material including regulatory documents, guidelines, European Public Assessment Reports on newly approved medications and other useful information. A free update service by e-mail is also available. Although English is the primary language used on the EMEA site, some of the information is available in other languages.Pharmaceutical companies are not using the Internet for pharmacovigilance yet. Rather, the Internet is being used for promotion of their products and for informing consumers on general information on diseases, for financial and investor data and for employment opportunities, etc. Other organisations such as lobbies, consumer groups and medical journals are also beginning to use the Internet.The electronic transmission of safety information, using the standards developed by the International Conference on Harmonization, is currently being tested for the transmission of individual patient adverse event information between companies and governments. In addition, the FDA has begun to accept adverse events from healthcare providers and consumers directly on line using an electronic version of its MedWatch form.

In humans, the absorption from nisoldipine CC occurs across the entire gastrointestinal tract with an increase in bioavailability in the colon because of the lower concentrations of metabolising enzymes in the distal gut wall. Although nisoldipine is almost completely absorbed, its absolute bioavailability from the CC tablet is only 5.5%, as a result of significant first-pass metabolism in the gut and liver.Nisoldipine is a high-clearance drug with substantial interindividual and relatively lower intraindividual variability in pharmacokinetics, dependent on liver blood flow. Nisoldipine is highly (>99%) protein bound. Its elimination is almost exclusively via the metabolic route and renal excretion of metabolites dominates over excretion in the faeces. Although nisoldipine is administered as a racemic mixture, its plasma concentrations are almost entirely caused by the eutomer as a result of highly stereoselective intrinsic clearance.Nisoldipine CC demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics in the therapeutic dose range and its steady-state pharmacokinetics are predictable from single dose data. Steady-state is reached with the second dose when the drug is given once daily and the peak-trough fluctuations in plasma concentration is minimal.Plasma-concentrations of nisoldipine increase with age. Careful dose titration according to individual clinical response is recommended in the elderly. Nisoldipine CC should not be used in patients with liver cirrhosis, though dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment are not necessary. Inter-ethnic differences in its pharmacokinetics are not evident.Owing to inhibition of metabolising enzymes, a small dosage adjustment decrement for nisoldipine CC may be required when it is given in combination with cimetidine. Concomitant ingestion of nisoldipine with grapefruit juice should be avoided. Inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, e.g. rifampicin (rifampin) and phenytoin should not be combined with nisoldipine CC, as they may reduce its bioavailability and result in a loss of efficacy. The concomitant use of other drugs which may produce marked induction or inhibition of CYP3A4 is contraindicated.Concomitant intake of the CC tablet with high fat, high calorie foods resulted in an increase in the maximum plasma concentrations of nisoldipine. This ‘foodeffect’ can be avoided by administration of the CC tablet up to 30 minutes before the intake of food.Plasma concentrations of nisoldipine are related to its antihypertensive effect via a maximum effect model. Nisoldipine CC once daily produce reductions in blood pressure which are maintained over 24 hours in the absence of releva effects on heart rate.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:50.730Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:50.730Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67740a4d83dcf45b3650f9","title":"Drug Therapy in Haemodialysis Patients","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00002512-199812060-00003","abstract":"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the stage of renal failure at which an individual requires dialysis therapy or a renal transplant to survive. The prevalence of ESRD is disproportionately higher among patients aged >65 years, and the average age of new ESRD patients is continually rising in the US Medicare population. Medication management in this population is challenging because of the combination of multiple comorbid disease states, a plethora of medications and the added dimension of dialysis therapy, as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes attributable to the aging process.Cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and arrhythmias are common in elderly patients with ESRD, and account for most of the deaths in this population. Constipation is common in patients aged >65 years, and its incidence is even higher among those receiving dialysis.Pain management is of particular concern because elderly dialysis patients are frequently prescribed inappropriate pain relief regimens. Many healthcare practitioners do not realise that patients with uraemia are at a higher risk of bleeding caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs than are patients with normal renal function. In addition, most practitioners do not appreciate that virtually all opioids (narcotics) and their active metabolites accumulate in patients with renal failure, leading to an increased risk of narcosis.Infectious complications are frequent in the ESRD population, with dialysis access infections and pneumonia being the 2 most common infections seen in hospitalised patients receiving dialysis treatment. The establishment of vaccination programmes for the prevention of hepatitis B, influenza and pneumococcal infections is important because of the increased risk of these diseases in this population. Unfortunately, these high-risk patients display, in general, a decreased immunogenic response to vaccinations.This article addresses some of the practical issues that surround the medication management or prevention of these particular diseases in elderly patients undergoing haemodialysis. Specifically, we discuss the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes that occur with specific medications in such patients. Drug dialysability is also discussed.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:54.158Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:54.158Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67740a4d83dcf45b3650fa","title":"Should Antibacterials Be Deregulated?","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00019053-199813050-00003","abstract":"Deregulation of antibacterials is a recurrent topic in the debate on pharmaceutical policy.

Clinical pharmacokinetic monitoring (CPM) helped many pharmacists to enter the clinical arena, but the focus was more on the pharmacists and tools. With the widespread acceptance of pharmaceutical care and patientfocused pharmacy, we now must take a sobering look at how clinical pharmacokinetics fits into the pharmaceutical care process.The existing literature is laden with articles that evaluate the effect of CPM on surrogate end-points. Many pharmacists have also had personal experiences that attest to the usefulness of CPM. Decreased mortality, decreased length of treatment, decreased length of hospital stay, decreased morbidity, and decreased adverse effects from drug therapy have been examined in an effort to measure and evaluate the impact of CPM on patient outcomes. While many of these studies demonstrated significant positive outcomes, several showed that CPM did not have a significant impact on specific patient outcomes. A few studies even found a negative impact on specific patient outcomes. Ultimately, there is good evidence in only a few specific patient groups to support the benefit of CPM.Despite the limitations of data supporting the routine use of CPM in managing drug therapy in diverse populations, many pharmacists continue to expend considerable time and effort in this activity. We need to define those patients who are most likely to benefit from CPM and incorporate this into our provision of pharmaceutical care, while minimising the time and money spent on CPM that provides no value.In redefining the patients who will benefit from CPM, we need to critically re-evaluate clinical studies on the relationship between drug concentration and response. Similarly, we need to pay special attention to recent studies evaluating the impact of CPM on outcomes in specific subpopulations. In the absence of specific studies demonstrating the value of CPM in particular patients, we propose that a more comprehensive decision-making process be undertaken that culminates in the quintessential question: ‘Will the results of the drug assay make a significant difference in the clinical decision-making process and provide more information than sound clinical judgement alone?’ We also need to consider opportunities to expand the use of CPM for new drugs and where new evidence suggests benefit.Even when there is strong evidence that CPM is useful in managing therapy in particular patient groups, clinicians need to remember that the therapeutic range is no more than a confidence interval and, therefore, we need to ‘treat the patient and not the level’. We need to incorporate the patient-specific and outcome-oriented principles of pharmaceutical care into our CPM, even as we utilise CPM as an essential tool in pharmaceutical care.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:54.159Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:23:54.159Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67740a4d83dcf45b3650fe","title":"The TESS Database","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00002018-199818010-00002","abstract":"The Toxic Exposure Surveillance System or TESS is a comprehensive poisoning surveillance database maintained by the American Association of Poison Control Centers.

Reports to US poison centres included in TESS originate both from the general public and from health professionals (12.9%) and include both patients managed at home or at the site of the exposure (73.6%) and those managed in hospitals, emergency departments, or other healthcare facilities (22.8%).TESS data are used by the pharmaceutical industry to monitor or defend product safety, by regulatory agencies proposing new regulations or considering new approvals or over-the-counter switches, and by clinical researchers attempting to characterise toxicity profiles or determine treatment protocols.

A total of 292 ADRs (1.9% over 15 415 prescriptions) were identified during the hospital stay, affecting 232 patients (11.1% over 2093 patients). 59 ADRs (20.2%) were due to the joint action of various drugs.

As a consequence, some of the published conclusions based on such studies must be viewed with care.A proper statistical analysis of bioequivalence is not frequently reported. A proper statistical analysis of the pharmacokinetic variables involves the calculation of 90% confidence intervals (CI) for the test : reference ratio of the means of the pharmacokinetic variables of the test and reference product. The CI must fall completely within the predetermined bioequivalence range (usually 0.8 to 1.25) for the products to be declared bioequivalent. Serious methodological errors, such as a conclusion of bioequivalence based on a lack of statistically significant difference between products, and conversely, a conclusion of bioequivalence because of a statistically significant difference, or because of a mere failure to show bioequivalence, are still made.With calcium antagonists in particular, an assessment of the rate of absorption and of the maximum concentration is important, as those characteristics may have implications for the safety profile with this class of drugs. As a minimum, in single doses studies the maximum concentration (Cmax), and the time to the maximum concentration (tmax), and in multiple-dose studies the Cmax, and the peak-trough fluctuation (%PTF) must be considered. SOme bioequivalence studies of calcium antagonists are deficient in this respect.To show bioequivalence for controlled-release formulations, multiple-dose studies are required but some published bioequivalence studies contain only single-dose assessments. Similarly, bioequivalence studies under fed conditions are rarely published, although food may have a significant effect on the absorption rate of these drugs. SOme calcium antagonists, such as verpamil, show stereoselective pharmacokinetics, so that enantiomers may have to be investigated.Unfortunately, few of the published studies of controlled-release calcium antagonists satisfy all requirements.

It is highly active in vitro against pathogens causing atypical pneumonia (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella spp.) and has similar activity to other macrolides against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Haemophilus influenzae is susceptible or intermediately susceptible to clarithromycin alone, but activity is enhanced when the parent drug and metabolite are combined in vitro.Absorption of clarithromycin is unaffected by food. More than half of an oral dose is systemically available as the parent drug and the active 14-hydroxy metabolite. Pharmacokinetics are nonlinear, with plasma concentrations increasing in more than proportion to the dosage. First-pass metabolism results in the rapid appearance of the active metabolite 14-hydroxy-tiarithromycin in plasma. Clarithromycin and its active metabolite are found in greater concentrations in the tissues and fluids of the respiratory tract than in plasma. Dosage adjustments are required for patients with severe renal failure, but not for elderly patients or those with hepatic impairment. Drug interactions related to the cytochrome P450 system may occur with clarithromycin use.In addition to the standard immediate-release formulation for administration twice daily, a modified-release formulation of clarithromycin is now available for use once daily.In dosages of 500 to 1000 mg/day for 5 to 14 days, clarithromycin was as effective in the treatment of community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections in hospital and community settings as β-lactam agents (with or without a β-lactamase inhibitor), cephalosporins and most other macrolides. Clarithromycin was similar in efficacy to azithromycin in comparative studies and is as effective as and better tolerated than erythromycin. Adverse events are primarily gastrointestinal in nature, but result in fewer withdrawals from therapy than are seen with erythromycin.Clarithromycin provides similar clinical and bacteriological efficacy to that seen with β-lactam agents, cephalosporins and other macrolides. It offers a cost-saving alternative to intravenous erythromycin use in US hospitals and is available in both once-daily and twice-daily formulations. The spectrum of activity of clarithromycin against common and emerging respiratory tract pathogens may make it suitable for use in the community as empirical therapy of respiratory tract infections in both children and adults.The activity of clarithromycin against most respiratory pathogens in vitro is similar to that of other macrolides. Streptococcus pyogenes isolates showed excellent susceptibility to clarithromycin. Clarithromycin is very active against pathogens causing atypical pneumonia (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila) and against Moraxella catarrhalis. The only characterised resistance pattern results in cross-resistance between macrolides, as seen in strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Isolates that are susceptible to erythromycin or penicillin are also susceptible to clarithromycin. Haemophilus influenzae is susceptible or intermediately susceptible to clarithromycin alone. The combination of the parent drug and metabolite shows at least additive if not synergistic activity, such that Haemophilus influenzae is susceptible in vitro to the combination. 14-Hydroxy-clarithromycin was also active against L pneumophila isolates. In vitro studies in blood show that clarithromycin is active against bacteria both intra-and extracellularly. Postantibiotic effects may occur with some species and bactericidal effects are seen with H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and possibly M. catarrhalis. In addition to its antimicrobial effects, clarithromycin appears to improve immune function and improves the viscoelastic properties of mucus and sputum.Absorption of clarithromycin is unaffected by food, oral bioavailability of the parent drug is 52 to 55% and first-pass metabolism produces the active 14-hydroxy metabolite. Pharmacokinetics are nonlinear as a result of hepatic elimination, with capacity-limited formation of the active 14-hydroxy metabolite occurring at doses >600mg. Total body clearance decreases and the elimination half-life increases with increasing dose, whereas plasma concentrations and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increase more than proportionately with increases in the dose. However, once steady-state is reached, no accumulation occurs with additional doses administered.Clarithromycin is not extensively protein bound but has a volume of distribution of 191 to 306L. Concentrations of the drug in respiratory tract tissues and fluids greatly exceed those in plasma. Furthermore, tissue concentrations of both clarithromycin and 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin exceed the MICs for most respiratory pathogens. About 40% of the drug is removed from the body in the faeces and ≈53% in the urine.Reductions in clarithromycin clearance seen in elderly patients and those with hepatic disease were well tolerated and do not appear to require dosage adjustments. In patients with renal failure, however, plasma concentrations and AUC values of the parent drug and active metabolite increase markedly, necessitating dosage reductions in patients with creatinine clearance (CLCR) values of ≤30 ml/min (≤1.8 L/h). Clarithromycin is found in breastmilk of nursing mothers treated with the drug.A modified-release formulation of clarithromycin has been developed to allow administration of the drug once daily. This formulation delivers the same peak and trough concentrations of the parent drug and metabolite and reaches equivalent AUC values to those seen with the twice-daily immediate-release formulation in the 24 hours after administration. The elimination half-life of clarithromycin and its 14-hydroxy metabolite are unaltered by formulation, although peak plasma concentrations are delayed with the once-daily dosage form.Results of comparative trials in adults have shown similar efficacy for clarithromycin and other antibacterial drugs in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute bronchitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), sinusitis, pharyngitis and otitis media. Comparator agents included the β-lactam agents ampicillin, amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid, phenoxymethyl-penicillin (penicillin V), the cephalosporins cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, ceftibuten and cefixime, and the macrolides erythromycin, azithromycin, dirithromycin, roxithromycin and josamycin.Clarithromycin 250mg twice daily for 5 days was as effective in the treatment of acute bronchitis as a 10-day course of the same daily dosage. No statistically significant differences in efficacy were apparent between smoking and nonsmoking patients or between elderly (≥65 years) and younger patients receiving clarithromycin. In hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were also receiving intravenous cefuroxime, oral clarithromycin was as effective as intravenous erythromycin, and intravenous clarithromycin followed by oral clarithromycin was as effective as intravenous followed by oral erythromycin.In children aged 5 months to 16 years, comparative trials have shown generally similar efficacy for clarithromycin and other antibacterial drugs in the treatment of pneumonia, acute bronchitis, pharyngitis and otitis media. Comparator agents with similar efficacy included amoxicillin, azithromycin, erythromycin, cefaclor, cefixime, clindamycin, cefadroxil and benzathine penicillin. A recent non-comparative Japanese study has shown clarithromycin to be an effective treatment of sinusitis associated with otitis media in children. Clarithromycin tended to produce better clinical success and bacteriological eradication than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis and acute bronchitis and produced similar clinical efficacy but superior bacterial eradication to phenoxymethylpenicillin in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis.Clarithromycin is generally well tolerated, with most adverse events being mild to moderate. The most common events were diarrhoea, abnormal taste, nausea, dyspepsia, headache and abdominal pain or discomfort, leading to treatment withdrawal rate of <3%. A similar pattern but slightly higher incidence of events occurs in children, but leads to treatment discontinuation in <2% of patients.Fewer digestive tract adverse events and withdrawals from treatment occur with clarithromycin than erythromycin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.Clarithromycin inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A enzyme (CYP3A) and its metabolism is affected by P450 enzyme induction. Thus, interactions increasing plasma concentrations and possible adverse effects of theophylline, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, carbamazepine, digoxin and rifabutin may necessitate therapeutic drug monitoring and dosage adjustments. Both rifampicin and rifabutin may induce clarithromycin metabolism. Clarithromycin may inhibit metabolism of omeprazole and omeprazole may inhibit the metabolism and/or increase the absorption of clarithromycin. Concomitant clarithromycin may also interact with zidovudine, ritonavir, methylprednisolone and loratidine, and can reduce the tolerability of fluoxetine, nitrazepam, ergotamine and possibly terfenadine and oral anticoagulants.Variations in drug acquisition costs and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for clarithromycin relative to other alternative therapeutic agents mean that local conditions must always be considered when assessing costs of clarithromycin use. However, in US hospitals, switching patients from intravenous erythromycin or cefuroxime to oral clarithromycin appears to reduce costs without affecting outcomes.Clarithromycin is usually administered orally, with or without food. Adult dosages for pharyngitis and tonsillitis (10-day courses) and for pneumonia or AECB (7-to 14-day courses) are 500 mg/day (as 1 or 2 doses, depending on the formulation used). AECB caused by H. influenzae (7-to 14-day course) and acute maxillary sinusitis (14-day course) are treated with 1000 mg/day. Paediatric dosages are usually 15 mg/kg/day for 10 days. Dosage adjustments are not usually needed in elderly patients or those with hepatic disease. Dose reductions or prolonged dosage intervals should be used in patients with renal failure (CLCR ≤30 ml/min or ≤1.8 L/h), in whom the use of the once-daily modified-release formulation should be avoided. The safety of clarithromycin has not been established in children <6 months old and the drug should be avoided during pregnancy and in patients with previous hypersensitivity to macrolide drugs. Breastmilk from mothers receiving clarithromycin should not be given to infants until treatment is completed.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:01.261Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:01.261Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774114d83dcf45b36510a","title":"Phase I clinical studies of S-1090: Safety and pharmacokinetics","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02355128","abstract":"S-1090, an oral cephem antibiotic, was given to healthy male volunteers in single (10 to 400 mg) and multiple (200 mg, twice a day) doses.

The approaches of proven value include low-dose heparin, low molecular weight heparin, oral anticoagulants and intermittent pneumatic compression.The use of one of the cited heparin nomograms will ensure that all patients are rapidly brought within the therapeutic range. Because of the varying sensitivities of thromboplastins, each laboratory should establish a therapeutic range using the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) which will correspond to 0.2 to 0.4 U/ml of heparin. Constant vigilance and a high level of suspicion are necessary to establish the clinical diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and to institute appropriate therapy. Physicians should be aware of the sensitivity of the thromboplastin being used in the performance of the International Normalised Ratio (INR).

Most pharmacokinetic interactions involve the modification of drug metabolism; the propensity of antiepileptic drugs to interact depends on their metabolic characteristics and action on drug metabolic enzymes.Phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and carbamazepine are potent inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP), epoxide hydrolase and uridine diphosphate glucurono-syltransferase (UDPGT) enzyme systems; oxcarbazepine is a weak inducer of CYP enzymes, probably acting on a few specific isoforms only. All stimulate the rate of metabolism and the clearance of the drugs which are catabolised by the induced enzymes.Valproic acid (valproate sodium) inhibits to different extents many hepatic enzyme system activities involved in drug metabolism and is able to significantly displace drugs from plasma albumin. Felbamate is an inhibitor of some specific CYP isoforms and mitochondrial β-oxidation, whereas it is a weak inducer of other enzyme systems.Topiramate is an inducer of specific CYP isoforms and an inhibitor of other isoforms. Ethosuximide, vigabatrin, lamotrigine, gabapentin and possibly zonisamide and tiagabine have no significant effect on hepatic drug metabolism.Apart from vigabatrin and gabapentin, which are mainly eliminated unchanged by the renal route, all other antiepileptic drugs are metabolised wholly or in part by hepatic enzymes and their disposition may be altered by metabolic changes.Some interactions are clinically unremarkable and some need only careful clinical monitoring, but others require prompt dosage adjustment. From a practical point of view, if valproic acid is added to lamotrigine or phenobarbital therapy, or if felbamate is added to phenobarbital, phenytoin or valproic acid therapy, a significant rise in plasma concentrations of the first drug is expected with a corresponding increase in clinical effects. In these cases a concomitant reduction of the dosage of the first drug is recommended to avoid toxicity. Conversely, if a strong inducer is added to carbamazepine, lamotrigine, valproic acid or ethosuximide monotherapy, a significant decrease in their plasma concentrations is expected within days or weeks, with a possible reduction in efficacy. In these cases a dosage increase of the first drug may be required.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:04.833Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:04.833Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774144d83dcf45b36510e","title":"Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00002018-199614040-00002","abstract":"After initial enthusiasm, the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) has been limited by the wide range of MAOI-drug and MAOI-food interactions that are possible, particularly with sympathomimetic medications or tyramine-containing foods, resulting in hypertensive reactions. Despite their clinical benefits, this has led to a reduction in use of such medications.Discovery of the 2 main subgroups of monoamine oxidase, types A and B, led to the synthesis of MAOIs selective for one or other of these isoenzymes. Consequently, selegiline (deprenyl), a selective MAO-B inhibitor, was developed for the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. This drug is useful in the treatment of the early stages of the disease and later on as an adjunct to other drug therapies. Although the selective MAO-A inhibitor, clorgiline (clorgyline), was found to be effective in the treatment of depression, it still retained the potential to cause hypertensive reactions.Recently, agents that are not only selective, but reversible in their inhibition of MAO-A (RIMAs) have been synthesised (e.g. moclobemide and toloxatone), and have proven antidepressant efficacy. Whilst they are less likely to induce hypertensive reactions with the concomitant administration of sympathomimetic drugs or with tyramine-rich foodstuffs, it still seems wise to advocate care in co-prescribing potentially interacting medications and to advise a degree of caution with regard to the dietary intake of foodstuffs likely to contain a high tyramine content. Although these newer drugs represent an advance in safety, their use has, as yet, only been established in the treatment of depression. RIMAs also retain a potential for adverse interaction with other drugs. Concomitant prescription of serotonin-enhancing drugs should only be undertaken with caution for patients on moclobemide, toloxatone or selegiline. Coprescription of sympathomimetic drugs should also be avoided with these newer MAOIs and patients should be advised against purchasing over-the-counter preparations that may contain sympathomimetic drugs.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:04.833Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:04.833Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774144d83dcf45b365110","title":"Influencing prescribing with drug use evaluation","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03309901","abstract":" D rug use evaluation (DUE) has been employed in the US hospital setting for more than 30 years as a means of influencing the prescribing behaviour of physicians.

Unlike the first-generation MAO inhibitors, the current drugs are readily reversible in their action, resulting in far less concern about interactions with certain foods and drugs which could lead to serious pressor effects. Furthermore, the current drugs are far more selective in their actions as a result of the ability to affect either the MAO-A or the MAO-B isoenzyme. Moclobemide is an example of a reversible MAO-A inhibitor which has been extensively studied and whose pharmacokinetic, clinical pharmacological and toxicological profiles have been thoroughly defined.Moclobemide has a short disposition half-life and intermediate values for systemic clearance and volume of distribution; half-life increases somewhat with dose. The drug is completely metabolised by the liver. Moclobemide is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration in a variety of dosages and forms. The drug has a high intrinsic (apparent oral) clearance which results in a substantial hepatic first-pass effect and, while there is marked interindividual variation, differences within an individual are small. A time- and dose-dependence is observed with multiple oral administration: clearance decreases with administration during the first week and thereafter remains constant. The exact mechanism of this effect is not known, but it may reflect inhibition of elimination by metabolites (the kinetics may always be described as being first-order).Moclobemide disposition is not affected by renal disease, nor is there substantial alteration with advanced age. Liver disease causes a dramatic reduction in clearance; dosage must be adjusted for patients with liver disease. There is minimal transfer of the drug into breast milk, such that breast-feeding neonates are exposed to only a very small dose of the drug.Moclobemide administration results in a minimal interaction with exogenous amines (e.g. tyramine and pressor amine drugs); the so-called ‘cheese effect’ is therefore of little concern. As a result, the drug has an excellent tolerability profile both within the therapeutic dose range and in overdose (no deaths have been attributed to moclobemide intoxication per se). Cimetidine inhibits the elimination of moclobemide. Moclobemide appears to affect several isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system (CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2). The adverse events profile of moclobemide indicates only mild and transient effects at a relatively low rate of occurrence.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:04.834Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:04.834Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67741b4d83dcf45b365114","title":"Pharmacokinetic Considerations in Gastrointestinal Motor Disorders","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003088-199528010-00005","abstract":"Although it has been recognised that alterations in gastrointestinal motility, whether induced by physiological or pathological processes, have significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs, this subject has received inappropriately little attention. Studies relating to this topic have focused on healthy volunteers and animals and have largely been confined to the effects of single drug doses. There is limited information about the effects of disease on pharmacokinetics under steady-state conditions.Changes in gastrointestinal motility may affect the pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs by altering the rate of delivery, bioavailability or mucosal absorption of the drug. In general the rate of absorption and time taken to achieve maximal plasma concentrations for well absorbed drugs may be modified by changes in gastrointestinal motility, but overall bioavailability is not usually affected. In these cases the therapeutic and clinical effects of the alteration in pharmacokinetics will, therefore, depend on which parameters are important for the action of the drug. For poorly absorbed drugs both the rate of absorption and bioavailability are likely to be altered by changes in gastrointestinal motility However, the complex effects of food and disease, as well as the properties and formulation of any drug (solubility, ease of dispersion, delayed release formulation) often make the prediction of the magnitude, or even the direction, of any effect difficult to predict. Drugs with direct effects on gastrointestinal motility may influence their own patterns of absorption.In patients with gastrointestinal motility disorders, drugs administered in a controlled release formulation, or those with poor bioavailability, are most likely to have a poorly predictable therapeutic effect. Care should be taken to ensure that the formulation of the drug, its timing of administration in relation to meals and the use of coadministered drugs optimise, or at least ensure consistent absorption.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:11.604Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:11.604Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67741b4d83dcf45b365117","title":"Management of Antidepressants in Overdose","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00023210-199402050-00005","abstract":"Antidepressant drugs are commonly used in attempted suicide. While the newer selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor antidepressants induce relatively minor effects when taken in overdose, the first generation tricyclics and second generation tri- and tetracyclic antidepressants cause life-threatening effects in overdose and, as a result, are the major cause of overdose deaths due to prescription drugs.Initial management should ensure a clear airway and adequate breathing and circulation. Investigations such as assessment of electrolyte, blood glucose and creatine kinase levels and arterial blood gases should be preformed. Since overdosage with many antidepressants can cause serious cardiovascular complications, electrocardiographical assessment is also an important aspect of general management.In patients who have taken an overdose of first generation tricyclics or second generation tri- and tetracyclic antidepressants, the principles of management are to reduce absorbtion (with charcoal), maintain oxygenation, optimise perfusion (with intravenous fluids and inotropic drugs) and use systemic alkalinisation to treat major cardiovascular arrhythmias. Appropriate treatment of cerebral symptoms (coma, seizures, myoclonus) may also be required. Although serotonin reuptake inhibitors are much less toxic when taken in overdose than other antidepressants, the management principles remain the same. Overdose with monoamine oxidase inhibitors produces characteristic abnormalities (hypertension, muscular rigidity, hyperthermia) that need specific treatment.All patients presenting with an overdose of an antidepressant should receive psychiatric and social assessment before discharge.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:11.605Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:11.605Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67741b4d83dcf45b365118","title":"Pharmacokinetic Optimisation of Therapy with Newer Antidepressants","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003088-199427040-00005","abstract":"Since the early 1950s, when imipramine was first introduced, a whole series of antidepressants with differences in structures, neurochemical effects and pharmacokinetics have been developed. Structurally or functionally, they have been classified as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In addition, there is a series of antidepressants with unique structures.Many of the newer TCAs appear to have shorter half-lives than the standard TCAs (e.g. imipramine), allowing for the possibility of a more rapid response, but requiring the drugs to be given in multiple daily doses, which may reduce patient compliance. The short time to peak plasma concentration (tmax) can also lead to rapid onset of adverse effects. The tetracyclic antidepressants have longer elimination half-lives (t½) than the TCAs, but there is only very minimal evidence for a relationship between drug concentrations in the blood and clinical response. The triazolopyridines, like the newer TCAs, show pharmacokinetic evidence for rapid onset of adverse effects and the need for multiple daily doses due to short tmax and t½.The newer MAOIs are a significant addition to therapy, as the rapid binding action of these medications increases their safety margin with regard to tyramine interactions. Further information in this area is required. In addition, moclobemide has pharmacokinetic features that are clinically beneficial (e.g. aging and renal dysfunction have little effect on the elimination of the drug), but also features that are not beneficial (e.g. nonlinear pharmacokinetics).Among the SSRIs, there are a range of t½ values for the parent drugs, from relatively short t½ values of less than 24 hours (paroxetine, fluvoxamine) to among the longest found (e.g. 2 days for fluoxetine). Only 2 of the agents (sertraline and citalopram) have linear pharmacokinetics, and 1 drug has nonlinear pharmacokinetics within the usual therapeutic range (fluvoxamine). Once a therapeutic blood concentration is established, linearity is helpful in avoiding the small dose changes and repeated rechecking of concentrations of medications that would be required for those agents with nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Sertraline stands out as having the best effects on behaviour among all antidepressants. However, fluoxetine and fluvoxamine are least likely to penetrate into breast milk.All 3 of the structurally unique newer antidepressants [amfebutamone (bupropion), viloxazine venlafaxine] have relatively short tmax values (1 to 2 hours), which may relate to the early onset of adverse effects. Amfebutamone has the benefits of linear pharmacokinetics with potential for defined therapeutic blood concentrations, lack of effect of liver enzymes on metabolism of the drug, and lack of significant effects of either aging or hepatic dysfunction on elimination of the drug.Thus, the antidepressants best suited for pharmacokinetic optimisation of therapy are the following: desipramine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram and amfebutamone.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:11.605Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:11.605Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67741b4d83dcf45b36511a","title":"Sexual risk profiles of delinquent and homeless youths","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02260362","abstract":"Relatively little is know about the sexual behaviors of high-risk adolescents, such as delinquent and homeless youths.

Dysphagia can be accompanied by a pain sensation in the chest mostly caused by impaction of the food bolus in the esophagus. Odynophagia describes only the status of painful swallowing without an impairment of the swallow and transport function. Drug-induced dysphagia can be caused in two different ways. First as a normal drug side effect of the pharmacological action of the drug or as a complication of the therapeutic action of the drug. The normal drug side effect is most likely in drugs that affect smooth or striated muscle function or the sensitivity of the mucosa. The drug effect on smooth muscle function that causes dysphagia can be inhibitory or excitatory. Dysphagia is a common clinical symptom in patients with reduced perception of the pharyngeal mucosa which leads to an subjective impairment of swallowing. Dysphagia caused by a complication of the therapeutic action of a drug includes viral or fungal esophagitis in patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs or cancer therapeutic agents, or antibiotics and immunological reactions to certain drugs such as erythema exsudativa multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Second, drug-induced dysphagia can be due to medication-induced esophageal injury (MIEI).

This form of medication-induced esophagitis is most likely to be found in elderly patients and patients with esophageal motility disorders.

The cyclic antidepressants differ in their relative ability to cause these adverse effects. The newer cyclic antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are relatively free of sedative and anticholinergic effects, but cause insomnia, nausea and possibly cardiac arrhythmias. All cyclic antidepressants appear to be equally effective. Therefore, the choice of a cyclic antidepressant for a specific patient must be based on several factors, including the risk of adverse effects.In elderly patients, the initial dose of cyclic antidepressants should be lower than the usual dose recommended for younger adults, and titrated slowly. All antidepressants require at least 2 to 3 weeks for their antidepressant effects to be seen. Because depression is a relapsing disease, maintenance antidepressant therapy may be indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent depression.The monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are effective antidepressants, especially in atypical depression. However, the adverse effects and risk of potentially lethal drug interactions of the older agents preclude their routine use. However, the new reversible MAO inhibitors may prove to be a well tolerated alternative in older patients.Antidepressant therapy should not be avoided simply because of a patient’s age. However, the clinician must be conservative in the use of cyclic antidepressants in elderly patients and monitor closely for adverse drug reactions.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:14.991Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:14.991Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774254d83dcf45b36512c","title":"Interaction between cytostatics and nutrients","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02988858","abstract":"Cancer patients have the highest prevalence of malnutrition of any group of hospitalized patients.

It has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, similar to that of ery-thromycin and inhibits a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, atypical pathogens and some anaerobes. Significantly, clarithromycin demonstrates greater in vitro activity than erythromycin against certain pathogens including Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Chlamydia pneu-moniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycobacterium chelonae subspecies — chelonae and — abscessus, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium avium complex, Legionella spp. and, when combined with its 14-hydroxy metabolite, against Haemophilus influenzae. However, bacterial strains resistant to erythromycin are also generally resistant to clarithromycin. The antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin appears to be enhanced by the formation in vivo of the micro-biologically active 14-hydroxy metabolite. In combination, additive or synergistic activity against a variety of pathogens including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella species (principally Legionella pneumophila) and various staphylococci and streptococci has been demonstrated. Clarithromycin has a superior pharmacokinetic profile to that of erythromycin, allowing the benefits of twice daily administration with the potential for increased compliance among outpatients where a more frequent regimen for erythromycin might otherwise be indicated.The clinical efficacy of clarithromycin has been confirmed in the treatment of infections of the lower and upper respiratory tracts (including those associated with atypical pathogens), skin/soft tissues, and in paediatrics. Clarithromycin was as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate drugs including β-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins) in some of the above infections. A most promising indication for clarithromycin appears to be in the treatment of immunocompromised patients infected with M. avium complex, M. chelonae sp. and Toxoplasma sp. Small initial trials in this setting reveal clarithromycin alone or in combination with other antimicrobials to be effective in the eradication or amelioration of these infections. Noncomparative studies have provided preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of clarithromycin in the treatment of infections of the urogenital tract, oromaxillofacial and ophthalmic areas. However, the promising in vitro and preliminary in vivo activity of clarithromycin against Mycobacterium leprae and Helicobacter pylori warrant further clinical trials to assess its efficacy in patients with these infections.Despite the improved pharmacokinetic profile and in vitro antimicrobial activity of clarithro-mycin over erythromycin, comparative studies of patients with community-acquired infections reveal the 2 drugs to be of equivalent efficacy. However, clarithromycin demonstrates greater toler-ability, principally by inducing fewer gastrointestinal disturbances.In conclusion, at this stage of its development clarithromycin appears to have a clinical profile which will make it a useful alternative to erythromycin, other macrolides and β-lactam antibiotics, for the treatment of community-acquired infections. Its activity against Mycobacteria including M. avium complex infection in AIDS patients may make it a first line option in this difficult to treat disease. Future comparative trials will help to further define its overall role in antimicrobial chemotherapy.Clarithromycin has an in vitro spectrum of activity broadly similar to that of erythromycin, although some significant differences in activity have been observed. Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis strains susceptible to penicillin and/or erythromycin are also susceptible to clarithromycin. However, where these organisms show resistance to erythromycin, clarithromycin is inactive. Clarithromycin is active against streptococcus groups A, B, C (particularly) and G, and against S. bovis. It is more active than roxithromycin against group A streptococci and is more active than erythromycin and azithromycin against S. bovis and group G streptococci. S. pneu-moniae strains are also particularly susceptible to clarithromycin, except where these strains are resistant to erythromycin. Enterococci (streptococcus group D) are usually resistant to clarithromycin. Clarithromycin is the most potent macrolide tested against Bacillus species, and it is more active than azithromycin and clindamycin against Listeria monocytogenes. Clarithromycin shows poor overall activity against Corynebacterium species, although this finding is considered to reflect resistance by a subpopulation of isolates.Overall, clarithromycin is either active or moderately active against Campylobacter species, but is notably more active than erythromycin, azithromycin and roxithromycin against Helico-bacter pylori. Haemophilus infiuenzae is either susceptible or resistant to clarithromycin and erythromycin but is susceptible or moderately susceptible to its primary metabolite, 14-hydroxy clarithromycin, in vitro. Indeed, 14-hydroxy clarithromycin is almost 3-fold more active than the parent compound against this organism. In contrast H. parainfluenzae is resistant to clarithromycin and erythromycin, although the activity of 14-hydroxy clarithromycin against this organism was not determined. Furthermore, despite the implications of these findings there are indications that Haemophilus species are susceptible to clarithromycin in the clinical setting. Combined laboratory data indicate that Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains (including those producing β-lacta-mase) are susceptible to clarithromycin and other macrolides although less so than to azithromycin and clindamycin. Overall, N. meningitidis is moderately susceptible to clarithromycin and erythromycin. Clarithromycin is particularly active against Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella par-apertussis and Borrelia burgdorferi, and is more active than erythromycin against the latter organism. Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (including β-lactamase producing strains) and strains of the Legionella genus (principally L. pneumophila) are susceptible to clarithromycin, which was the most active of the macrolides tested against L. pneumophila. Pasteurella multocida is more susceptible to clarithromycin than to erythromycin.Clinical isolates of Bacteroides species were generally resistant to clarithromycin and erythromycin, although B. melaninogenicus is particularly susceptible to clarithromycin as is Pro-pionibacterium acnes. Clarithromycin was moderately active against Clostridium species and it was the most active macrolide tested against Eubacterium species. Peptococcus species show varying sensitivities to clarithromycin, although against combined isolates of the Peptococcus/Pep-tostreptococcus genera clarithromycin was moderately active.Clarithromycin was the most potent of the macrolides tested against Chlamydia trachomatis and C. pneumoniae (TWAR), and produced potent inhibition of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Isolates of Ureaplasma urealyticum were generally susceptible to clarithromycin, although other strains are resistant. Mycoplasma hominis is resistant to clarithromycin and erythromycin.Clarithromycin is active against Mycobacterium chelonae subspecies -chelonae and -abscessus and is generally moderately active against M. fortuitum-fortitum and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), consistently showing greater activity than other macrolides. Clarithromycin also shows activity against other mycobacterium species including Mycobacterium marinum, Myco bacterium kansaii and Mycobacterium fortuitum-peregrinum. The metabolic function of M leprae was similarly inhibited by clarithromycin and standard antileprotic drugs. Clarithromycin is inactive against M. tuberculosis and, like azithromycin, appears to have parasitostatic activity against Toxoplasma gondii.In general, bacterial strains resistant to erythromycin are also resistant to clarithromycin, although bacterial strains resistant to penicillin class drugs are susceptible to clarithromycin where macrolide resistance is absent. The combination of clarithromycin plus its 14-hydroxy metabolite demonstrates additive or synergistic activity against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Legionella species, and some streptococci and staphylococci.Clarithromycin is bactericidal against a variety of organisms including H. influenzae, L. pneu- mophila, S. pneumoniae and M. avium complex, and demonstrated a postantibiotic effect against H. influenzae, S. aureus, S. pyogenes and β-haemolytic Streptococci.Clarithromycin produces its antimicrobial effect by inhibition of intracellular protein synthesis. It is widely distributed throughout the body, is highly concentrated in tissues, organs (particularly the lung) and leucocytes, and enhances phagocytosis. Clarithromycin causes significant morphological changes in the cell wall of M. avium complex leading to cytoplasmic vacuolation.Clarithromycin produces good antimicrobial activity in experimental models of infection induced by a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (including L. pneumophila and H. influenzae) and other organisms including M. avium complex and M. leprae.Clarithromycin is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, although it undergoes substantial first pass metabolism reducing systemic bioavailability to 55% after a 250mg dose in healthy volunteers. Maximum clarithromycin plasma concentrations (Cmax) in healthy ‘Western’ volunteers were 0.62 to 0.84 mg/L and 1.77 to 1.89 mg/L following single dose administration of clarithromycin 250 and 500mg, respectively. Marginally higher values were recorded in Japanese volunteers administered clarithromycin 200 or 400mg. In these studies the time to reach Cmax(tmax) was about 3 hours, irrespective of ethnic origin. The areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) were about 4 and 11 mg/L · h for doses of 250 and 500mg in ‘Western’ volunteers, but were approximately doubled in Japanese volunteers givęn 200 or 400mg.Clarithromycin undergoes rapid biotransformation to produce the microbiologically active 14-hydroxy (R) metabolite, which achieves peak plasma concentrations of 0.4 and 0.8 mg/L within 3 hours of administering clarithromycin 250 or 500mg. In ‘Western’ volunteers AUC values for the 14-hydroxy metabolite were 3.1 to 4.9 and 6.1 to 6.9 mg/L·h following administration of clarithromycin 250 or 500mg, respectively. The presence of food does not appear to have a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of clarithromycin. With continued administration of clarithromycin 250mg twice daily, steady-state is usually attained after 5 doses with Cmax for the parent and 14-hydroxy metabolite of 1 and 0.6 mg/L, respectively. Steady-state maximum plasma concentrations of 2.4 to 3.5 mg/L for clarithromycin and 0.7 to 0.8 mg/ L for the metabolite are achieved with a 500mg dose. Oral administration of clarithromycin 200mg resulted in a Cmax 3-fold greater, and an AUC 5-fold greater than those for erythromycin 200mg.Clarithromycin appears to be widely distributed throughout the body, generally achieving higher concentrations in tissues and organs (including the lung and tonsils) than in blood. Indeed, reported values for volume of distribution have been large — 226 to 266L in ‘Western’ volunteers and 115 to 138L in Japanese volunteers. At concentrations representative of those achieved clinically, clarithromycin was 42 to 70% bound to human plasma protein.The primary metabolic pathways for clarithromycin are oxidative N-demethylation and hy-droxylation, which are saturable resulting in nonlinear kinetics. The principal metabolite of clarithromycin is the 14-hydroxy derivative, which is mainly excreted with the parent drug via urinary mechanisms. The elimination half-life (t1/2β) for clarithromycin ranged from 2.6 to 4.4 hours and the plasma clearance from 42 to 64 L/h when administered in doses of 250 to 500mg to ‘Western’ volunteers. Values for t1/2β were very similar in Japanese volunteers, but total body clearance was much lower’(22 to 24 L/h). In ‘Western’ children, the pharmacokinetic profile of clarithromycin is consistent with that seen in adults. Limited data in Japanese children reveal AUC and t1/2β values to be about half those in Japanese adults receiving similar doses. A reduction in urinary clearance in the elderly and patients with severe renal insufficiency is associated with an increase in AUC, Cmax and/or t1/2β. Mild-to-severe hepatic impairment does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin, although reduced metabolite formation may occur with severe liver impairment.Clarithromycin is effective in the treatment of several types of infection when administered as a 250 or 500mg dose twice daily in ‘Western’ adult patients, or in lower divided doses in Japanese adults. In noncomparative studies, the clinical success rate for clarithromycin in ‘Western’ patients with lower respiratory tract infections was 94 to 99%, whereas the clinical efficacy (excellent plus good responses) derived from Japanese studies ranged from 86 to 91%, except in bronchiectasis (58%). Bacterial eradication rates in Japanese studies ranged from 70 to 94% for the most commonly isolated pathogens. In comparative studies of ‘Western’ patients with pneumonia, acute bronchitis or acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, clarithromycin produced clinical cure rates of 47 to 96%, clinical success rates of 76 to 100% and bacteriological eradication rates of 57 to 100%. In these studies, the clinical efficacy of clarithromycin was at least comparable with that of erythromycin, josamycin, roxithromycin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime and/or ce-fixime. The clinical efficacy of clarithromycin in Japanese patients with pneumonia, bronchitis or bronchiectasis, was also equivalent to that of cefaclor (77 vs 67%) but greater than that of midecamycin acetate (90 vs 74%), bacteriological eradication rates in these studies showing similar trends for the various drugs.Upper respiratory tract infections (including those of the middle ear), also responded well to clarithromycin. Thus, in noncomparative ‘Western’ studies (employing dosages of 250 or 500mg twice daily), clinical success rates of 84 to 97% were recorded. In noncomparative Japanese trials, clinical efficacy rates of 62 to 87% were recorded, whilst bacteriological eradication rates of 75 to 94% were noted for the most commonly isolated organisms (S. aureus, S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae). In comparative studies in ‘Western’ patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, clarithromycin therapy produced clinical cure in 80 to 96% of patients, clinical success in 95 to 100% of patients and bacteriological eradication rates of 88 to 100%. Patients with acute maxillary sinusitis also responded well to treatment with clarithromycin as evidenced by clinical cure rates of 58 to 69%, clinical success rates of 85 to 95% and bacteriological eradication rates of 89 to 92%. Clarithromycin was considered equally effective as erythromycin or phenoxymethyl penicillin in treating pharyngitis and as effective as amoxicillin (with or without clavulanic acid) in treating acute maxillary sinusitis. Clarithromycin also demonstrated efficacy equivalent to that of josamycin in the treatment of acute tonsillitis and acute suppurative otitis media in Japanese patients. In the treatment of tonsillitis, clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates of 87 and 99% were noted for clarithromycin. Clarithromycin was less effective in the treatment of suppurative otitis media, as evidenced by clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates of 63%.In the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections, clarithromycin was associated with an overall efficacy rate of 74% and bacteriological eradication rates of ⩾86% in Japanese noncomparative studies. Furthermore, in a Japanese comparative study, clarithromycin and erythromycin were similarly effective (clinical response rates 83 vs 79% and bacteriological eradication rates 92 vs 93%). Clarithromycin was also shown to be equally effective as erythromycin or cefadroxil in ‘Western’ patients with skin and soft tissue infections. Clinical success rates of 95 and 96% were noted for clarithromycin and comparator drugs, respectively, while bacteriological eradication rates were identical for the two groups (92%).In Japanese noncomparative studies, the clinical efficacy of clarithromycin in the treatment of infections of the urogenital tract ranged from 48 to 92% (depending on the causative pathogen), with the greatest responses elicited in those with chlamydial (92%) or ureaplasmic infections (85%). Oromaxillofacial and ophthalmic infections responded with efficacy rates of 74 to 89%.In preliminary studies of Mycobacterium avium complex infection in AIDS patients, clarithromycin, either alone or in combination with other antimicrobial drugs, has been shown to reduce or eradicate the pathogen from blood samples, and this has been associated with clinical improvement. Clarithromycin has also shown promising activity in immunocompromised patients with disseminated Mycobacterium chelonae — chelonae infection or toxoplasma encephalitis.Clarithromycin has a proven efficacy in the treatment of paediatric infections in Japanese and ‘Western’ patients. Thus, in Japanese noncomparative studies where clarithromycin suspension was usually given at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg bodyweight twice or 3 times daily, excellent plus good clinical response rates of 80 to 97% were recorded for Japanese children with impetigo, infections of the respiratory tract or gastrointestinal tract. In ‘Western’ comparative studies, clarithromycin 7.5 mg/kg twice daily (maximum 250mg twice daily) in suspension was considered as effective as phenoxymethylpenicillin for streptococcal pharyngitis, amoxicillin (with or without clavulanic acid) for acute otitis media, cefadroxil or erythromycin for skin or skin structure infections and amoxicillin for lower respiratory tract infections.Preliminary studies have shown clarithromycin to be effective in the treatment of infection with Helicobacter pylori and in the treatment of leprosy.Analysis of 4291 ‘Western’ patients revealed an adverse event rate of 19.6% for clarithromycin, the most common occurrences being nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia and headache. In excess of 90% of these adverse events were either mild or moderate in severity. The adverse event rate for clarithromycin was similar to that of common β-lactam antimicrobials, although in comparison with pooled data for other macrolides (erythromycin, josamycin and roxithro-mycin), clarithromycin caused substantially fewer gastrointestinal effects, particularly when compared with erythromycin alone. Premature discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events for clarithromycin (3 to 3.5%) was similar to that with β-lactam antimicrobials (2.7 to 3.5%) but was significantly less than that with other macrolides considered together (5.9%). Increased trans-aminase levels were recorded for patients treated with clarithromycin or other macrolides. However, the incidence of elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase was significantly lower (about 2-fold) for clarithromycin compared with other macrolides, especially josamycin.The recommended oral dosage of clarithromycin in adult ‘Western’ patients with various community-acquired infections (excluding M. avium complex) is 250 to 500mg twice daily for 7 to 14 days. Preliminary data suggest that clarithromycin 1 to 2 g/day is suitable for the treatment of AIDS patients with M. avium complex. ‘Western’ paediatric clinical studies employed a clarithromycin dosage of 7.5 mg/kg bodyweight twice daily (maximum 250mg twice daily) for 5 to 10 days. In adult Japanese patients the recommended dosage for clarithromycin is 400mg twice daily, whereas in Japanese children it is 10 to 15 mg/kg bodyweight in 2 or 3 divided daily doses. It is recommended that the duration of treatment be adjusted depending on the nature and severity of the infection, however, the duration in most Japanese clinical studies has been 7 to 14 days.Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that dosage adjustment is appropriate in the presence of severe renal impairment. However, in the absence of this condition, dosage adjustment is not necessary in mild to severe hepatic impairment or for the elderly.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:21.262Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:21.262Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67742e4d83dcf45b365139","title":"Endogenous Substances as Drugs","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00002018-199000051-00012","abstract":"Cytokines are the protein products of cells which regulate proliferation, differentiation and functional activation. The potent biological properties of these proteins have led to their introduction into clinical medicine as pharmacological agents.

Although they have most often been studied in cancer patients, widespread application of these agents in many other fields is likely. Despite the fact that these are recombinant proteins of defined sequence, their intricate biology complicates clinical investigation. Proteins may be of native or mutated sequence and their degree of glycosylation is further affected by the expression system used for their production. Furthermore, although these cytokines interact with specific cell surface receptors, pleotropic biological consequences may follow from the interaction of ligand with receptors. As a consequence, significant dose and schedule dependency exists for these agents, and the particular administration regimen as well as the route of delivery may greatly affect the biological and clinical characteristics of these drugs. Thus, direct comparisons of different cytokine problems may be difficult. These issues reinforce the need for increased biological understanding of cytokines if these agents are to be used rationally and safely in clinical medicine.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:30.539Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:30.539Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67742e4d83dcf45b36513a","title":"Poisoning Due to Class 1B Antiarrhythmic Drugs","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03259923","abstract":"Since most of the toxicity associated with class 1B antiarrhythmic drugs is dose-related, this review examines adverse effects seen in both therapeutic practice and accidental or premeditated overdose. Toxicity is very common with these agents and can be life-threatening. A high percentage of patients must discontinue therapy because of adverse effects. Mexiletine and tocainide are structural analogues of lignocaine (lidocaine) and toxicity is similar with all 3 drugs.With gradual intoxication (the most common form) central nervous system effects such as lightheadedness, dizziness, drowsiness and confusion are seen first. Seizures and respiratory arrest can occur. Cardiovascular toxicity is manifested by progressive heart block, reduced cardiac contraction, hypotension and asystole. Both mexiletine and tocainide may have proarrhythmic effects. Gastrointestinal toxicity is also common.Shock, hypotension, cardiac failure and β-blocker therapy reduce lignocaine clearance and enhance the risk of intoxication during routine therapy. Both lignocaine and mexiletine elimination is impaired in severe liver disease while tocainide clearance is reduced in renal failure.Management of toxicity is largely supportive and symptomatic. Lignocaine infusion must be discontinued and decontamination of the gut in the case of oral preparations is recommended. Serious intoxication requires intensive care unit admission. Haemodialysis or haemoperfusion may be helpful in serious lignocaine and tocainide poisoning. In institutions where extracorporeal circulatory assistance is available, massive lignocaine poisoning has been successfully treated with this intervention.In the therapeutic setting serious toxicity can be prevented by close clinical surveillance and appropriate dose reduction in patients with reduced drug clearance. Because of the large interindividual variation in lignocaine pharmacokinetic parameters, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended if results can be reported quickly. Mexiletine and tocainide have stereoselective metabolism and assays do not distinguish the more active isomers. Therapeutic drug monitoring is less useful in this situation.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:30.540Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:30.540Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67742e4d83dcf45b365138","title":"Effect of dimethadione derived from repeated oral administration of trimethadione on pancreatic secretion in dogs","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02779362","abstract":"The effect of the weak organic acid of dimethadione (DMO) on secretin-stimulated pancreatic secretion was studied with repeated oral administration of trimethadione (TMO), the precursor of DMO, to dogs at a dose of 10 to 160mg/kg/day for a period of 14 days. The bicarbonate concentration in pancreatic juice at a steady state decreased significantly, reflecting a close correlation with the dose of TMO and DMO concentrations in plasma and pancreatic juice. The maximal decrement from the control of cases of no TMO administration was 18.8 mEq/1 (12.1% of the control level). The chloride concentration in pancreatic juice showed a reciprocal relation to the bicarbonate concentration. The sum of both anion concentration was constant, irrespective of the dose of TMO. The average carbon dioxide tension of pancreatic juice in all doses of TMO was lower than that of the control, but differences were not statistically significant. The pH, flow rate, sodium and potassium concentrations in pancreatic juice at a steady state did not differ significantly in relation to the dose of TMO. These findings suggest that repeated oral administration of TMO cause a significant decrease in bicarbonate concentration in pancreatic juice, resulting probably from the buffer action of bicarbonate on protons provided from the undissociated form of DMO.","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:30.539Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:30.539Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67742e4d83dcf45b36513b","title":"Antidepressants","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003495-198937050-00006","abstract":"Supplementing but not supplanting the original series of tricyclic and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor compounds, a new generation of antidepressant medications has been developed and marketed throughout the past decade.

First, some of the methods which have been used to assess the pharmacodynamics of ACE inhibitors in humans are presented. They include humoral assays (e.g. ACE activity in plasma, renin activity, etc.), haemodynamic changes (blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, etc.) and agonist challenges (angiotensin I infusions). Subsequently a pharmacokinetic-dynamic model is described, based on biochemical processes obtained after ACE inhibition, which seems to be useful for the interpretation of the complex processes. The various correlations between plasma drug concentration on the one hand and plasma ACE activity, angiotensin II concentration in plasma or blood pressure on the other, are discussed on the basis of this model.From the model obtained it becomes obvious that under many circumstances the release of the inhibitor from ACE binding is the step which in fact determines the pharmacodynamically relevant elimination rate of the drug at low concentrations, whereas at high concentrations the elimination of the drug is mainly dependent on kidney (and/or liver) elimination rate. The dynamic-kinetic correlations are then presented for some ACE inhibitors in various disease states: arterial hypertension, heart failure, old age, renal failure, liver disease. In a final section the kinetic and dynamic relevance of interactions of ACE inhibitors with food and other drugs is described (e.g. prostaglandin inhibitors, diuretics, digoxin and Cimetidine). Despite the great body of literature which deals with the kinetic and/or dynamic properties of ACE inhibitors, precise knowledge of the relationship between their kinetic and dynamic behaviour is rather limited and there is a clear need for further studies to elucidate this complex topic, thereby improving therapeutic possibilities with these useful new compounds.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:33.725Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:33.725Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774314d83dcf45b365143","title":"Pre-treatment with somatostatin in the anaesthetic management of a patient with carcinoid syndrome","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03010865","abstract":"Carcinoid syndrome produces flushing, bronchoconstriction and gastrointestinal hypermotility secondary to serotonin, histamine, bradykinin and prostaglandin release.

For this reason, nicotine gum has recently been introduced as an adjuvant to smoking cessation. The introduction of nicotine as a ‘therapeutic’ entity necessitates a careful examination of its clinical pharmacokinetics.Insufficient data exist to quantitatively assess the absorption of nicotine after oral administration. Based upon physicochemical and pharmacokinetic principles, the oral bioavailability of nicotine would be expected to be less than 20%. The limited data available in the literature appear to support this conclusion. Absorption from the oral mucosa is the principal site of nicotine absorption in subjects who chew tobacco or nicotine gum. Absorption by this route is highly pH dependent. Nicotine is also readily absorbed from the nasal mucosa, and after topical administration.Nicotine distributes extensively into body tissues with a volume of distribution ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 L/kg. Nicotine has been shown to transfer across the placenta and into breast milk in humans. Plasma protein binding is negligible, ranging from 4.9 to 20%.The predominant route of nicotine elimination is hepatic metabolism. Although a number of metabolites of nicotine have been identified, it is unclear whether any of these compounds contribute to the pharmacological effect of nicotine. Nicotine is also excreted unchanged in urine in a pH-dependent fashion. With urinary pH less than 5, an average 23% of the nicotine dose is excreted unchanged. When urinary pH is maintained above 7.0, unchanged nicotine urinary excretion drops to 2%.After intravenous administration, nicotine exhibits biexponential decline in plasma. Total plasma clearance ranges from 0.92 to 2.43 L/min. During urinary acidification, renal clearance averages 0.20 L/min. Non-renal blood clearance averages 1.2 L/min, indicating that nicotine elimination is dependent on hepatic blood flow.The literature is devoid of information regarding the effect of disease on the pharmacokinetics of nicotine. Based upon the drug’s pharmacokinetics in healthy smokers, it would be anticipated that disease states which alter hepatic blood flow may have the greatest impact on nicotine pharmacokinetics. In addition, drugs which alter hepatic blood flow may cause significant alterations in the systemic clearance of nicotine.Dependence on smoking appears to be related, at least in part, to the achievement of a rapid rise in plasma nicotine concentrations. If this assessment is correct, the most desirable adjuvant for smoking cessation would be one that closely mimics this pattern of plasma nicotine concentrations. Thus, the slow rise in plasma concentrations after chewing nicotine gum may suggest a pharmacokinetic explanation for the relatively high failure rate with this method of smoking cessation. It appears that because the rate of nicotine absorption is even slower than with the gum formulation, transdermal preparations are unlikely to be a satisfactory alternative to smoking. Further investigations are, therefore,equired to determine a formulation which gives the desired plasma nicotine concentration profile.One of the major effects of smoking on drug therapy is the induction of drug-metabolising enzymes. However, the effects on drug metabolising capacity when a subject changes from smoking to nicotine gum has not yet been studied. The effect nicotine itself has on drug metabolism in humans is also unknown.Considerable work remains to define adequately the clinical pharmacokinetics of nicotine. Determination of factors which influence the efficacy of nicotine as an adjuvant in smoking cessation may prove beneficial in reducing the number of tobacco consumers worldwide.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:40.010Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:40.010Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774384d83dcf45b365151","title":"Nifedipine","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003088-198712010-00002","abstract":"The availability of specific chemical assays and the development of appropriate biological models have made it feasible to study the relationship between the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of nifedipine, a relationship that is presumed to be sigmoidal for most effects. In healthy volunteers the haemodynamic effects of a single dose of nifedipine are markedly influenced by the pharmaceutical preparation and the rate of drug input. When the plasma concentration of nifedipine increases rapidly, such as after an intravenous bolus injection or rapidly disintegrating capsules, there is a marked increase in heart rate and little or even no effect on blood pressure. On the other hand, when the drug is given as a slow intravenous infusion or as a sustained release tablet and when the capsules are taken together with food, the decrease in blood pressure is accompanied by few or no changes in heart rate. Furthermore, it has been shown that not only haemodynamic effects of nifedipine, but also oesophageal motor function may be used as a quantifiable pharmacological effect. For patients with angina pectoris, a plasma concentration range that is associated with optimal treatment has not been defined, since large inter-individual variations in the nifedipine plasma concentration were observed in effectively treated patients. For patients with hypertension, significant sigmoidally shaped correlations between blood pressure reduction and nifedipine plasma concentrations following single or multiple doses have been demonstrated. The concentration-effect parameters were very similar to those found for normotensive subjects. After 6 weeks of treatment the potency of the drug had decreased, which might indicate the development of some tolerance. In patients with severe renal impairment, the maximal effect of nifedipine on diastolic blood pressure was more than doubled, which cannot be explained by differences in pharmacokinetics; therefore these patients appear to be more sensitive at the pharmacodynamic level. In patients with liver cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine were quite different due to reduced protein binding and reduced enzyme activity; in patients with a portacaval shunt, considerable increased bypassing of the liver during the first pass after oral administration was observed. When corrected for free drug concentrations, the concentration-effect relationship for these patients is essentially the same as that found for healthy subjects. β-Blocking agents administered together with nifedipine have been found to interact at both the kinetic and the dynamic levels, but the effects are highly dependent upon dose and route of administration. When 2 drugs are given together, the clearance of each may change, probably as a result of their transient opposite effects on hepatic blood flow. The effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure were found to be increased by combined administration. H2-Receptor blocking agents have been shown to interfere with the kinetics of nifedipine. Cimetidine, and to a lesser extent ranitidine, inhibited its metabolism markedly,causing a more pronounced antihypertensive effect. Smoking interfered with the action of nifedipine in patients with angina pectoris. When these patients stopped smoking, they suffered fewer anginal attacks and could exercise longer; the nifedipine plasma concentrations, before and after discontinuation of smoking, were at the same level. It is concluded that it is feasible to study the influence of certain factors on the pharmacological response to nifedipine in a quantitative fashion by characterising the concentration-effect relationship in terms of well-defined parameters.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:40.011Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:40.011Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67743b4d83dcf45b36515a","title":"Distribution, elimination, metabolism and bioavailability of hexamethylenebisacetamide in rats","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00179430","abstract":"Hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA), an in vitro differentiating agent, was studied for its pharmaco-dynamic actions in animals.

Peak plasma concentrations bear a constant relationship to dose, but vary widely between individuals. The bioavailability of ranitidine after oral administration is approximately 50% due to presystemic hepatic metabolism. Plasma protein binding of ranitidine is approximately 15% and the apparent volume of distribution is greater than body volume. Ranitidine penetrates very poorly into the cerebrospinal fluid but is concentrated into breast milk.After intravenous administration, plasma concentrations decay in a biexponential manner. The elimination half-life is almost 2 hours and is somewhat longer after oral administration. Plasma clearance is approximately 600 ml/min of which most is renal clearance. Elimination of ranitidine is not dose-dependent. Hepatic metabolism is the other major route of elimination and there may be some enterohepatic recycling of the drug.Food has no effect on the kinetics of ranitidine but concurrent administration of antacids reduces its absorption. Renal disease causes an increase in ranitidine plasma concentrations through reduced clearance and possibly increased bioavailability. Chronic liver disease causes an increase in the bioavailability of ranitidine and some reduction in clearance. In the elderly, there is a reduction in clearance and prolongation of the elimination half-life but little effect on bioavailability.

Cyclophosphamide was repeatedly administered i.p. to stimulate proliferative activity of the urothelium in particular of the bladder. Phenacetin was either fed continuously or administered repeatedly by gavage at the time when cyclophosphamide-induced stimulation of proliferative activity was highest. After 16 months approximately one half of the surviving rats developed uni- and bilateral hyperplasias of the lining epithelium of the renal papilla which were characterised by an endophytic growth pattern and a urothelial differentiation. They were always associated with healed or-rarely-fresh micronecroses of the subjacent papillary tissue. The urothelial hyperplasia of the renal papilla cannot be considered as true preneoplastic, but rather as reactive proliferative lesion in the sense of a reparative hyperregeneration in response to the observed toxic micronecroses. The present experiments did not provide evidence for a solitary carcinogenic effect of ph in the entire lower urinary tract. It seems most likely that a metabolite of ph only plays a role as cocarcinogen with initiation-stimulating and/or initiation-promoting activity in multifactorial multistage carcinogenesis acting together with other causative factors. Thus, the assumption that ph represents a complete solitary carcinogen for the urothelium in man has to be reassessed. Prospective epidemiological investigations should not only consider the consumption of ph-containing analgesics alone, but also the entire occupational and non-occupational environment with its potential carcinogenic and cocarcinogenic hazards.","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:58.325Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:58.325Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67744a4d83dcf45b36516e","title":"Influence of Food Intake on Presystemic Clearance of Drugs","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003088-198308040-00002","abstract":"Many drugs have a low degree of oral bioavailability even though their gastrointestinal absorption is complete. This is because they undergo extensive presystemic metabolic transformation during the first passage of the drug through the gastrointestinal mucosa and the liver. In addition to effects on the absorption of some drugs, food intake has been found to influence the bioavailability of drugs with extensive presystemic metabolic clearance.Extensive presystemic clearance occurs commonly with compounds that are lipophilic bases, e.g. propranolol and amitriptyline, but rarely if ever with lipophilic acids, e.g. salicylic acid and penicillin, except for esters of such acids, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and pivampicillin. While presystemic clearance of (esterified) acidic drugs is unaffected by food, concurrent food intake markedly reduces presystemic clearance, and thus enhances bioavailability, of several lipophilic bases. Among these are propranolol, metoprolol, labetalol, dixyrazine and hydralazine, which are presystemically metabolised by hydroxylation, glucuronidation and acetylation enzyme systems. In contrast, the bioavailability of lipophilic bases which undergo presystemic dealkylation (amitriptyline, codeine, dextropropoxyphene, prazosin, zimelidine) is unaffected by concurrent food intake. Food intake reduces presystemic clearance of hydralazine and propranolol when these drugs are administered in conventional rapid-release tablets but not when they are given in slow-release formulations. Likewise, coadministration of hydralazine reduces presystemic clearance of rapid-release but not slow-release propranolol. These and other observations favour the view that food may reduce presystemic clearance of (certain) lipophilic basic drugs via transient, complex effects on splanchnic-hepatic blood flow and/or shunt processes, and that the extent of this effect is influenced by the rate of drug delivery to the liver. In addition, these findings refute the notion that the reduced presystemic clearance results from (long-lasting) hepatic enzyme inhibition by some nutrient. On the other hand, repeated intake of specific nutrients (protein) and food contaminants (benzpyrene) can enhance presystemic drug clearance by enzyme induction. Thus, food may exert a dual effect on presystemic drug clearance. A complete evaluation of the influence of food on presystemic drug clearance necessitates bioavailability studies carried out following both single and repeated meals, including different kinds of food prepared by various cooking methods.The influence of food on the presystemic clearance of drugs is most likely to be clinically relevant with drugs having narrow therapeutic margins and/or steep dose-response curves.Its importance may be minimised by stipulating that drugs always be taken in the same relation to meals. Alternatively, the problem can be circumvented by employing formulations that minimise the food influence, or by the use of drugs that have little or no presystemic clearance.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:58.324Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:24:58.324Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67744d4d83dcf45b365178","title":"Effect of bethanechol on gastric functions in primary anorexia nervosa","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01367671","abstract":"We have shown previously that patients with primary anorexia nervosa (PAN) have decreased gastric emptying and acid output.

Although bethanechol caused fractional emptying and acid output to increase threefold in PAN (P<0.05), it failed to produce stimulation of gastric emptying and acid output to levels similar to those achieved in controls. Therefore, gastric emptying and acid output were less in PAN than in controls, both basally and after bethanechol. Since bethanechol failed to completely restore acute gastric function, the defect of emptying and acid output in PAN does not appear to be caused by a deficiency of parasympathetic neurotransmitter but, instead, could reflect undetermined inhibitory influences or impaired function of the muscular and glandular cells.

Hepatic disease might alter (increase) bioavailability by either or both of 2 mechanisms: decreased hepatic extraction due to impaired hepatic drug metabolising activity, or portosystemic shunting. Few studies have examined the effect of liver diseases on bioavailability, and even fewer have attempted to directly measure hepatic extraction of drugs in liver disease. Data are conflicting, with some evidence to suggest that hepalocyte function is preserved in moderate cirrhosis, while other evidence suggests a decrease in hepatic metabolic function. Several studies show relative preservation of systemic clearance in the face of substantial increases in bioavailability, suggesting that the hepatic arterial blood supply of the liver is an important determinant of systemic clearance in cirrhotic patients.Increases in bioavailability and decreases in systemic clearance have multiplicative, rather than additive, effects on area under the plasma concentration-time curve after oral administration. Clinically, there are important implications of these studies. If differences in response between patients with and without liver disease are seen after equivalent intravenous doses of a high clearance drug, the differences may be further accentuated after oral dosing. Delayed toxicity, due to accumulation of high clearance drugs is more likely to occur because of the longer half-life and larger available dose. Physicians should use extra caution in administering high clearance compounds to patients with liver disease.","year":"2012","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:25:01.392Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:25:01.392Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67744d4d83dcf45b36517d","title":"Les lésions précancéreuses de l’estomac","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02973705","abstract":"Deux lésions gastriques répondent à la définition des lésions pré-néoplasiques:La voie d’évolution vers la cancérisation est dans les deux cas une métaplasie intestinale et surtout une dysplasie d’intensité variable.

Four studies included patients with MCI/AD, and one study included cognitively normal individuals. Saffron was well-tolerated in all groups. Regarding cognitively impaired patients, scores on Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale or Mini mental state examination were significantly better when saffron was compared with placebo and did not differ significantly when saffron was compared with donepezil or memantine. Saffron effects on functional status were similar with its effects on cognition.Saffron was shown to be equally effective to common symptomatic drugs for MCI/AD and resulted in no difference in the incidence of side effects, when compared with placebo or drugs.

Liver fibrosis was measured by histological examination. The oxidative stress-related biomarkers were measured with spectrophotometry. Expressions of mRNA and protein were measured by real-time PCR and Western blotting.Bile duct-ligated rat treatment with astragaloside IV and ferulic acid in combination resulted in synergistic alleviation of hepatic fibrosis. Simultaneously, activation of hepatic stellate cells was significantly inhibited by the combination therapy when compared with astragaloside IV or ferulic acid alone. Interestingly, astragaloside IV, but not ferulic acid, induced accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus, synthesized antioxidant enzymes through negative regulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, scavenged reactive oxygen species, and, in turn, suppressed hepatic stellate cells activation in bile duct-ligated rats. Conversely, ferulic acid, but not astragaloside IV, suppressed TGF-β1 and its receptors expression, which resulted in downregulation of Smad3 and Smad4.These findings suggest that the combination of astragaloside IV and ferulic acid synergistically induces deactivation of hepatic stellate cells through inhibition of the TGF-β pathway and activation of the Nrf2 pathway, and suggest that combination of astragaloside IV and ferulic acid is a promising candidate for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:25:32.184Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:25:32.184Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67746c4d83dcf45b3651be","title":"Complementary and alternative medicine use among patients with psoriasis on different treatment regimens","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00403-019-02022-8","abstract":"The aim of this study was to explore habitudes about the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with psoriasis.

It ran from 2012 and ended abruptly in 2015 and was followed by increased advocacy for sustaining the MCH (antenatal, delivery, postnatal and immunization) services as a policy priority. Advocacy is important in allowing social voice, facilitating prioritization, and bringing different forces/actors together. Therefore, the study set out to understand how advocacy works - through understanding what effective advocacy implementation processes comprise and what mechanisms are triggered by which contexts to produce the intended outcomes.The study used a Realist Evaluation design through a mixed quantitative and qualitative methods case study approach. The programme theory (PT) was developed from three substantive social theories (power politics, media influence communication theory, and the three-streams theory of agenda-setting), data and programme design documentation, and subsequently tested. We report information from 22 key informant interviews including national and State policy and law makers, policy implementers, CSOs, Development partners, NGOs, health professional groups, and media practitioners and review of relevant documents on advocacy events post-SURE-P.Key advocacy organizations and individuals including health professional groups, the media, civil society organizations, powerful individuals, and policymakers were involved in advocacy activities. The nature of their engagement included organizing workshops, symposiums, town hall meetings, individual meetings, press conferences, demonstrations, and engagements with media. Effective advocacy mechanism involved alliance brokering to increase influence, the media supporting and engaging in advocacy, and the use of champions, influencers, and spouses (Leadership and Elite Gendered Power Dynamics). The key contextual influences which determined the effectiveness of advocacy measures for MCH included the political cycle, availability of evidence on the issue, networking with powerful and interested champions, and alliance building in advocacy. All these enhanced the entrenchment of MCH on the political and financial agenda at the State and Federal levels.Our result suggest that advocacy can be a useful tool to bring together different forces by allowing expression of voices and ensuring accountability of different actors including policymakers. In the context of poor health outcomes, interest from policymakers and politicians in MCH, combined with advocacy from key policy actors armed with evidence, can improve prioritization and sustained implementation of MCH services.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:25:41.817Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:25:41.817Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774754d83dcf45b3651cd","title":"Ameliorating Effects of Natural Antioxidant Compounds on Female Infertility: a Review","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43032-020-00312-5","abstract":"The prevalence of female infertility cases has been increasing at a frightening rate, affecting approximately 48 million women across the world. However, oxidative stress has been recognized as one of the main mediators of female infertility by causing various reproductive pathologies in females such as endometriosis, PCOS, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, and unexplained infertility. Nowadays, concerned women prefer dietary supplements with antioxidant properties over synthetic drugs as a natural way to lessen the oxidative stress and enhance their fertility. Therefore, the current review is an attempt to explore the efficacy of various natural antioxidant compounds including vitamins, carotenoids, and plant polyphenols and also of some medicinal plants in improving the fertility status of females. Our summarization of recent findings in the current article would pave the way toward the development of new possible antioxidant therapy to treat infertility in females. Natural antioxidant compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and other dietary sources, alone or in combination with other antioxidants, were found to be effective in ameliorating the oxidative stress-mediated infertility problems in both natural and assisted reproductive settings. Numerous medicinal plants showed promising results in averting the various reproductive disorders associated with female infertility, suggesting a plant-based herbal medicine to treat infertility. Although optimum levels of natural antioxidants have shown favorable results, however, their excessive intake may have adverse health impacts. Therefore, larger well-designed, dose–response studies in humans are further warranted to incorporate natural antioxidant compounds into the clinical management of female infertility.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:25:41.817Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:25:41.817Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774754d83dcf45b3651cf","title":"Chinese herbal medicine reduces mortality in patients with severe and critical Coronavirus disease 2019: a retrospective cohort study","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11684-020-0813-6","abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in patients with severe/critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We reported the clinical features and therapeutic characteristics of moderate COVID-19 cases in Wuhan that were treated via the integration of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We collected electronic medical record (EMR) data, which included the full clinical profiles of patients, from a designated TCM hospital in Wuhan. The structured data of symptoms and drugs from admission notes were obtained through an information extraction process. Other key clinical entities were also confirmed and normalized to obtain information on the diagnosis, clinical treatments, laboratory tests, and outcomes of the patients. A total of 293 COVID-19 inpatient cases, including 207 moderate and 86 (29.3%) severe cases, were included in our research. Among these cases, 238 were discharged, 31 were transferred, and 24 (all severe cases) died in the hospital. Our COVID-19 cases involved elderly patients with advanced ages (57 years on average) and high comorbidity rates (61%). Our results reconfirmed several well-recognized risk factors, such as age, gender (male), and comorbidities, as well as provided novel laboratory indications (e.g., cholesterol) and TCM-specific phenotype markers (e.g., dull tongue) that were relevant to COVID-19 infections and prognosis. In addition to antiviral/antibiotics and standard supportive therapies, TCM herbal prescriptions incorporating 290 distinct herbs were used in 273 (93%) cases. The cases that received TCM treatment had lower death rates than those that did not receive TCM treatment (17/273 = 6.2% vs. 7/20= 35%, P = 0.0004 for all cases; 17/77= 22% vs. 7/9= 77.7%, P = 0.002 for severe cases). The TCM herbal prescriptions used for the treatment of COVID-19 infections mainly consisted of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae, Radix Scutellariae, Rhizoma Pinellia, and their combinations, which reflected the practical TCM principles (e.g., clearing heat and dampening phlegm). Lastly, 59% of the patients received treatment, including antiviral, antibiotics, and Chinese patent medicine, before admission. This situation might have some effects on symptoms, such as fever and dry cough. By using EMR data, we described the clinical features and therapeutic characteristics of 293 COVID-19 cases treated via the integration of TCM herbal prescriptions and Western medicine.

Choices were perceived to affect fertility via internal accumulation and blockage (e.g., of menstrual blood), structural damage (e.g., burnt eggs), internal movement of contraceptive material, deliberate toxicity preventing population growth and behavioral effects impeding sexual activity. Diverse feared consequences of infertility were reported (e.g., polygamy, economic hardships). Fears were reported to affect reproductive behaviour (e.g., stopping contraception), help-seeking and social behaviour.FOI is a phenomenon that should be studied in its own right.

Around the world, forest grazing by livestock became a controversial management practice, gradually restricted in many countries over the past 250 years. This was also the case in most Central and Eastern European countries, including Hungary, where forest grazing was a legally prohibited activity between 1961 and 2017. Until the 2010s, ecologists and nature conservationists considered it merely as a historical form of forest use. As a result, there is little contemporary scientific information available about the impact of forest grazing on vegetation and the traditional ecological knowledge associated with it. Our aim was to explore and summarize this type of knowledge held by herders in Hungary.We interviewed 58 knowledgeable herders and participated in forest grazing activities in 43 study locations across the country. The results were analysed qualitatively.We revealed a living ecological knowledge tradition and practice of forest grazing in native and non-native forest stands. The impact of livestock grazing on native and non-native forests is not considerably different, in the view of the herders. For both forest types, the greatest impact of grazing was the suppression of the shrub layer, while grazing also increased the dominance and palatability (“tameness”) of the grasses. Livestock could cause significant damage to seedlings during forest grazing, but if done with care, grazing could also be an integral part of forestry management.Sustainability of current forest grazing practices depends on the depth of local and traditional knowledge applied and herders’ stewardship. We stress the importance of collaborating with holders of local and traditional knowledge in order to gain a better understanding of the effects of livestock grazing on vegetation in temperate forests.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:25:51.387Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:25:51.387Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67747f4d83dcf45b3651dc","title":"Effect of acupuncture on women with poor ovarian response: a study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13063-020-04690-8","abstract":"Poor ovarian response (POR), a manifestation of low ovarian reserve and ovarian aging, leads to a significant reduction in the pregnancy rate after in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer.

Tritrichomonas foetus strains cause the disease trichomoniasis in farm animals (cattle, bulls, pigs) and diarrhea in domestic animals (cats and dogs). Because some T. vaginalis strains have become resistant to the widely used drug metronidazole, there is a need to develop alternative treatments, based on safe natural products that have the potential to replace and/or enhance the activity of lower doses of metronidazole. To help meet this need, this overview collates and interprets worldwide reported studies on the efficacy of structurally different classes of food, marine, and medicinal plant extracts and some of their bioactive pure compounds against T. vaginalis and T. foetus in vitro and in infected mice and women. Active food extracts include potato peels and their glycoalkaloids α-chaconine and α-solanine, caffeic and chlorogenic acids, and quercetin; the tomato glycoalkaloid α-tomatine; theaflavin-rich black tea extracts and bioactive theaflavins; plant essential oils and their compounds (+)-α-bisabolol and eugenol; the grape skin compound resveratrol; the kidney bean lectin, marine extracts from algae, seaweeds, and fungi and compounds that are derived from fungi; medicinal extracts and about 30 isolated pure compounds.

Significantly, in further animal verification experiment we using naturally ageing rats with NAFLD as a model, we found that MXD administration ameliorated age-related NAFLD and mechanistically down-regulated the mRNA/protein expression of core targets in lipid metabolism and inflammation related pathways such as FASN, ACACA, IL-6, and NF-κB. In addition, 12 of 24 potential ingredients acting on verified targets came from BC, and 11 of 24 potential ingredients acting on verified targets were derived from SM, implying that both BC and SM served as the key role in MXD against NAFLD.The bioinformatics data and in vivo experimental results suggest that the MXD-induced amelioration of NAFLD may be predominantly related to modulation of lipid metabolism and inflammation. Both BC and SM serve as the key role in MXD against NAFLD.

The primary outcomes are the time interval to the patient’s next exacerbation during a 180-day following up and the COPD assessment test (CAT) during treatment. Secondary outcomes include lung function, TCM syndrome assessment, laboratory tests, and safety. The changes of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenaline axis (HPA axis) and inflammatory cytokine will be measured as well.By demonstrating the advantages of utilizing TCM and an appropriate duration of systemic glucocorticoids, this effectiveness comparison trial will provide new references to physicians on how to improve the management of COPD exacerbation. The results of HPA axis and inflammation cytokine measurements will shed light on the molecular mechanisms and entail further mechanism studies.www.chictr.org.cn ChiCTR1900023364.

As TCM&nbsp;embodies multiple treatment modalities, only the most popular two, namely CHM (Chinese herbal medicine) and acupuncture, were discussed. Publications,&nbsp;especially reviews involving randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of TCM on allergic diseases, published up to June 2019 were reviewed and&nbsp;analyzed. Papers reporting the mechanisms of action of TCM in allergic diseases were also included. Other publications in Chinese were also discussed.A startling escalation in the incidence of allergic diseases in the last several decades has posed tremendous social and financial burdens on the community.&nbsp;Failing to locate a cure for these chronic diseases, patients have resorted to using alternative medications of which traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a&nbsp;popular one. Thus CHM has been extensively employed for treating allergic diseases. Some investigations have been conducted to ascertain the therapeutic&nbsp;efficacy of CHM for allergic diseases.Although CHM has been widely deployed for treating allergic diseases, it appears from the published data that there is a dearth of conclusive evidence to&nbsp;establish the effectiveness of CHM for allergic diseases. It is recommended that more large- scale RCTs with prolonged durations be carried out to&nbsp;corroborate the efficacy of CHM for allergic diseases. On the other hand, there is ample evidence indicating that acupuncture is useful when administered&nbsp;alone in allergic rhinitis and asthma or when applied as an adjunct to conventional western therapy. Evidence of its utility in atopic eczema and urticaria is&nbsp;not definitive. It is recommended that acupuncture be integrated into the therapy of allergic rhinitis and asthma, and that CHM be used as an adjunct in the&nbsp;treatment of allergic diseases on an individual basis.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:25:55.150Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:25:55.150Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774894d83dcf45b3651ec","title":"Triterpene saponins from Barringtonia acutangula (L.)

We also examined the possible synergistic hepatoprotective impact of the combination between BVJ and 2,3- dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, the currently approved drug for Pb-toxicity). The evaluation depends on the ability of BVJ, DMSA, or their combination (BVJ-DMSA) to reduce serum and hepatic Pb level and to avoid oxidative stress and inflammation caused by Pb. The level of lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity, and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes were quantified. In addition, the level of interleukin (IL)-6, nitric oxide (NO), DNA fragmentation, and liver histology were studied.The results showed that BVJ contained considerable amounts of betalains, vitamin C, and various types of phenolic compounds. Therefore, BVJ displayed a significant (p < 0.05) preventive influence on the elevation of Pb levels in blood and liver as well as the hepatic DNA fragmentation. In addition, it significantly (p < 0.05) improved most of the studied antioxidant and inflammatory markers in the Pb-intoxicated rats. However, the combined extract (BVJ-DMSA) revealed synergistic (combination index < 1) activities in most of the tested parameters. The histopathological results verified the biochemical findings of this research.BVJ has a potent efficiency in the protection from Pb-induced hepatotoxicity through the reduction of its accumulation in blood and liver and the prevention of the oxidative stress and inflammation induced by Pb.

Transdisciplinarity encounters Semmelweis’ biography, which is neither linear nor totally focused on medicine. He completed the philosophicum (artisterium), studying the septem artes liberales (1835–1837) in Pest, comprising humanities and natural science. After moving to Vienna, he began to study law, but turned to medicine as early as 1838. In 1844, he graduated with a&nbsp;botanical doctoral thesis composed in Neo-Latin, showing linguistic and stylistic talent and a&nbsp;broad knowledge of gynecology and obstetrics. The style and topoi demonstrate the interchangeability of what he learnt during his propaedeuticum. Nowadays, hardly anyone is familiar with this booklet, for two main reasons: the language choice and the life-saving impact of the physician’s opus magnum on the reasons for puerperal fever (Die Aetiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers). In later life, he became convinced that he had no talent as a&nbsp;(scientific) author—a&nbsp;fatal error that led him to become a&nbsp;victim of what we now call “publish or perish.” Semmelweis had felt rejected for years. This negative feeling was the reason for his decision not to publish his great book for 14 years. When it finally went to the printer in 1861, the scientific community did not accept it. This experience caused psychosomatic symptoms owing to his long-standing and deeply felt disappointment. Bad conscience tortured him. This permanent stress destroyed his health: in 1865, his relatives (including his wife) and friends took him from Budapest to Vienna. He thought he was going to spend some time relaxing, but in fact was led into a&nbsp;newly built asylum for the mentally ill, the Niederösterreichische Landesirrenanstalt. When he realized what was happening, he tried to escape. Badly abused, he died from sepsis caused by open wounds and a&nbsp;dirty straightjacket 2&nbsp;weeks later. This article will show Semmelweis to be a&nbsp;multilingual author of scientific literature and (open) letters; it will present him as a&nbsp;researcher who became a&nbsp;victim of harassment and what is referred to as the “Semmelweis reflex” (“Semmelweis effect”); and it will focus on his afterlife in (children’s) literature, drama, and film.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:04.462Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:04.462Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67748c4d83dcf45b3651fd","title":"The Optimal Nutritional Programme for Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13679-020-00384-z","abstract":"Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe and complex obesity; however, the risk of developing nutrient deficiencies varies based upon the type of surgery, degree of malabsorption, and level of nutrition intervention.

Investigating home gardens was regarded as an effective way to understand the biodiversity-related local knowledge and culture of native people in Ethnobiology and Ethnoecology. Home garden is important in less developed and remote areas. The grand canyon of Yarlung Tsangpo is designed as one of the biodiversity hotspots of China, and it is one of the most remote regions of China, because of the rough traffic conditions. The aim of the present study is to collect, record, and document the plants and their local knowledge and functions in the local home gardens, then attempt to answer the question: “why local people selected these plants?”The study area was in Beibeng Township of Motuo County in the grand canyon of Yarlung Tsangpo. Observation and semi-structure interviews with informed consent were used to collect data in field study. All information was collected and organized, then documented based on “ethno-species” as a fundamental unit. All of the information of local use and knowledge were organized as the list of “use-report” for quantitative analysis, and the local uses of plants were merged into 14 use categories. Frequency of citation (FC), relative frequency of citation (RFC), cultural importance index (CI), and cultural value index (CV) were used in quantitative analysis. Besides, the Jaccard Index was used to compare the similarity in plant species selection among different communities.A total of 78 home gardens in the 9 communities of Beibeng Township were visited, and 196 ethno-species were collected. These ethno-species were identified into 188 Botanical taxa. A total of 87 home garden owners as informants were interviewed in the present study, and they provided 625 use-reports to us. The top 5 important plants were Su-lan-tsao (Dendrobium nobile), Sa-ga (Zingiber officinale), Soe-lu (Capsicum annuum), Snying-pa (Citrus medica), and Kham-pu (Prunus persica), according to the quantitative analysis. The most citied use-category was “vegetable,” followed by “ornamental plant,” “medicine,” and “fruit.” The altitude might be the most important impact factor of the plant diversity and composition of home gardens, and the traffic conditions, local terrain, also impact the plant diversity and composition of home gardens.In remote areas such as the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon, the plants in home gardens are important sources of plant products such as foods, herbal medicines, and fibers to support daily lives. The local home gardens in Tsang-la communities had high diversity of plants, and these plants provided many functions and services to support daily lives of local people. Local plant knowledge, including the features, life forms, habits, habitats, and use values of plants, were the summary of the understanding of local people to their surrounding plant worlds.

Four hundred and seven respondents selected by multi-stage sampling technique were interviewed. Descriptive and inferential statistics were done, and the level of significance was set at 0.05. Qualitative data collection involved four focus group discussions a year after the epidemic was declared over in the country. The discussions were recorded, transcribed and analyzed along major themes.All respondents were aware of EVD with radio and television being the major sources of information. Knowledge of the disease was however very poor with many misconceptions and it was significantly influenced by educational level of respondent. EVD survivors will be welcomed back into the community by few residents (36.8%) and a much fewer proportion (27.2%) will freely entertain a survivor in their house. Most would prefer local herbalists over orthodox medical practitioners to care for their loved one in case they contract EVD. Although respondents knew that burying a victim is dangerous, they opposed cremation.There was poor knowledge of EVD with a lot of misconceptions. Community members were not pro-active about prevention with dire consequences in the event of an outbreak.

Most probable is that it has its origin in the eastern Mediterranean area. It has been kept for its fragrance and has a history of being a medicinal and insect-repellent plant. In earlier centuries, the plant was commonly found in peasants’ gardens in Sweden and utilised especially as a component in the bouquets brought to church by women. The aim of this article is to bring together data about Artemisia abrotanum and to summarise its cultural history and folk botanical importance. In Sweden, it is still grown in some gardens in the countryside and is esteemed for its fragrance.In the early twentieth century, various folklore archives in Sweden (Lund, Uppsala) distributed questionnaires about the use of church bouquets. These records provided interesting information about the importance of southernwood and other species. We have also used data found in ethnographic records and local historical reports. Between 2007 and 2017, a nationwide inventory organised by the Programme for Diversity of Cultivated Plants (POM) documented and gathered several heirloom varieties of southernwood.Together with a few other domestic plants of foreign origin (e.g. Lavandula angustifolia Mill., Tanacetum balsamita L., and Tanacetum vulgare L.), Artemisia abrotanum has been cultivated throughout Sweden in peasants’ gardens as a medicinal plant and for its fragrance. According to the sources, Artemisia abrotanum was one of the most common species cultivated by the Swedish peasantry. Although used in folk medicine and to some extent as a repellent, it was most esteemed for its fragrance. Peasant women would carry a twig of the plant in the obligatory church bouquet or in the hymnal when attending the services in the Lutheran church on Sundays. In Sweden, this custom with the church bouquet has been known since the time of the Reformation in the sixteenth century and survived until the late nineteenth century, when major changes took place in connection with industrialisation, modernisation, secularisation and urbanisation. Although the custom with the church bouquet disappeared, nationwide inventories conducted by the Programme for Diversity of Cultivated Plants in 2007–2015 revealed that the plant still exists in many gardens on the countryside throughout Sweden as a cultural relict and reminiscence plants. People care for the plant, have sentiments for it and it is spread from person-to-person. Several heirloom varieties have been discovered, which will be preserved ex situ for the future.Southernwood was probably the most commonly used herb in the peasant women’s church bouquet until the end of the nineteenth century. It had a satisfying fragrance and was easy to grow. Although the custom has disappeared, the plant has survived until the present day in many gardens as a reminiscence of the custom of former times.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:10.513Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:10.513Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774924d83dcf45b365206","title":"Anti-inflammatory effect of Ganluyin, a Chinese classic prescription, in chronic pharyngitis rat model","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12906-020-03057-5","abstract":"Ganluyin (GLY) is a famous classical prescription with a long history of use as a treatment for inflammatory conditions such as chronic pharyngitis (CP) in many parts of China. However, it has not been developed as a modern pharmaceutic and its anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the anti-inflammatory efficacy of GLY and potential mechanisms in a rat model of CP.The chemical profile of GLY was analyzed by HPLC-UV. We used a mouse model of ear edema and a rat model of paw edema. Specifically, xylene was used to induce edema on the surface of one ear in mice, and carrageenan was injected subcutaneously into the right hind paws of rats to induce paw edema. The paw thickness, ear weight, and ear perfusion were measured and recorded. The CP model in rats was induced by irritating the throat with 5% ammonia and was used to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of GLY. Levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured by ELISA in serum, and protein expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and nuclear factor kappa-B p65 (NF-κB p65) in the throat were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot to evaluate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of GLY. Hematological assays were also conducted.There were four flavonoids identified in GLY: naringin, neohesperidin, baicalin, and wogonoside. The oral administration of GLY showed a significant inhibitory effect on xylene-induced ear swelling and ear blood flow in mice and significantly ameliorated rat right hind paw edema at doses of 6.2 and 12.4 g/kg. Mechanistic studies found that the anti-inflammatory activity of GLY was related to the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and PGE2 and that GLY reduced the expression of COX-2 and NF-κB p65 proteins in the throat, attenuated throat injury, and reduced inflammatory exudates. Hematological analysis showed that treatment with GLY prevented increases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil (NEUT), lymphocyte (LYMPH) and monocyte (MONO) levels.These studies indicated that GLY has beneficial anti-inflammatory effects on CP and that it acts through reducing pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and PGE2, as well as decreasing WBC, NEUT, LYMPH and MONO levels and decreasing the expression of COX-2 and NF-κB p65 proteins. These findings may lay the groundwork for further studies of GLY as a suitable candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as CP.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:10.513Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:10.513Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774924d83dcf45b365205","title":"Medicinal dietary plants of the Yi in Mile, Yunnan, China","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13002-020-00400-5","abstract":"The Yi is the largest ethnic group in Yunnan Province (China), with a population of five million.

Moreover, SGE decreased the production of C-reactive protein in serum and the expression of IL-6, IL-1β, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 in the joint muscles. SGE also recovered the decreased Tregs. Results from the in vitro experiments showed that SGE not only inhibited the proliferation and migration of human synovial cell but also inhibited the IL-1β-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8. Similarly, SGE inhibited the activation of NF-κB and the expression of COX-2.SGE attenuated the collagen-induced arthritis through inhibiting the synovial hyperplasia and inflammation.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:14.025Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:14.025Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774964d83dcf45b365209","title":"Impact of naturopathy, yoga, and dietary interventions as adjuvant chemotherapy in the management of stage II and III adenocarcinoma of the colon","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00384-020-03711-x","abstract":"Naturopathy, Yoga and Dietary interventions are known to improve the quality of life in cancer patients.

Four themes were identified as important factors related to medication adherence: attitudes toward disease, attitudes toward treatment, attitudes toward family support and attitudes toward health care team. Specifically, symptoms at diagnosis, understanding and acceptance in taking medication, the presence of family support and the perception of concern by the doctor relate to improved medication compliance.Medication adherence in Thai patients with diabetes requires support from both the health care providers and the family. The patient’s perception of the doctor’s concern creates greater patient trust in the health care team.

The present study was carried out to investigate the protective effect of the Sri Lankan TBQ in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.We investigate the ethyl acetate extract of the Sri Lankan TBQ for its antibacterial effects against the keystone periodontopathic bacterium, P. gingivalis and also its antioxidant potential, which is important to protect the periodontium from oxidative stress. Further, its safety was analyzed using the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay on human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs).Ethyl acetate extract of this TBQ inhibited the growth of P. gingivalis with a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 125 μg/ml. It was found to be a rich source of polyphenols and displayed considerable DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities and a strong ferric reducing antioxidant power. This extract could protect the cultured human gingival fibroblasts from H2O2 induced oxidative stress. In addition, this TBQ extract was not genotoxic to human PBLs even at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. Moreover, it exhibited protective effects against bleomycin induced genotoxicity in PBLs.Ethyl acetate extract of the Sri Lankan TBQ is a source of natural antibacterial compounds against P. gingivalis. It is also a source of natural antioxidants which can protect human gingival fibroblasts from H2O2 induced oxidative stress. These properties of the TBQ may have contributed to its claimed antiperiodontopathic effects. Besides, it was found to be relatively non-toxic to human cells.

Levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) and the ratio of ALP to TRACP both in serum and bone were measured for the evaluation of bone turnover rate. The bone mRNA and protein expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), d2 isoform of vacuolar (H+) ATPase (ATP6V0d2), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2), M-CSF, Wnt5a, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were detected for evaluating bone metabolism.The results showed that EF&LLF improved bone mass and bone quality by preventing bone loss, increasing maximal load as well as protecting the micro-structural retrogressive change of trabecular bone in SOP rats; ameliorated the steatosis in the liver and decreased blood lipids and serum ALT, AST and GGT; enhanced bone remodeling by stimulating the expression of ALP and TRACP. At the molecular levels, EF&LLF stimulated the osteoclastogenesis by upregulating the protein and mRNA expression of OPG, RANKL, M-CSF and ATP6V0d2; meanwhile, EF&LLF stimulated osteoblastogenesis by enhancing the expression of TGF-β1, BMP2, Wnt5a and IGF-1. According to our established MLP model, EF&LLF has a better effect on osteoclastogenesis or steoblastogenesis in SOP rats than EF or LLF.These findings demonstrate that the systemic bone protective effects of EF&LLF by promoting bone remodeling in aging rats might be a substitute medicine for the treatment of SOP.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:19.839Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:19.839Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67749f4d83dcf45b365219","title":"Effectiveness and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Medicine in Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer after Chemotherapy Failure: Protocol of a Prospective Multicenter Cohort Study","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11655-020-3420-0","abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths and has the third highest incidence in the world.

Kouyanqing Granule (KYQG) has been used to treat inflammatory diseases of the mouth and throat, including recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), traumatic ulcers, oral leukoplakia and so on. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of KYQG in treating these diseases are still unclear. We aimed to explore the possible mechanisms in KYQG for the treatment of oral ulcers.An innovative network pharmacology method was established by incorporating targets searching and fishing, network analysis, and silico validation to discover the pharmacological mechanisms of action of KYQG for the treatment of oral ulcers. Then, we verified the reliability of this method by an animal experiment.Our data indicated that a total of 47 key targets were screened, which mainly involved in three function modules including the inhibition of inflammation, the regulation of immunological response, and the suppression of oxidative stress. The implementation of these functions relies on the complex multi-pathways network, especially TNF signaling pathway and HIF-1 signaling pathway. The results of the experimental verification indicated that KYQG significantly inhibited the serum levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in rats with oral ulcer.KYQG exhibited the therapeutic effects on oral ulcers probably by inhibiting inflammation, regulating immunological response, and suppressing oxidative stress through a complex multi-pathways network. Particularly, TNF signaling pathway and HIF-1 signaling pathway may play crucial roles in the protection of KYQG against oral ulcers. This work not only offers a method for understanding the functional mechanisms of KYQG for treating oral ulcer diseases from a multi-scale perspective but also may provide an efficient way for research and development of complex composition formula.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:23.310Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:23.310Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f67749f4d83dcf45b36521c","title":"An ethnoveterinary study on medicinal plants used by the Buyi people in Southwest Guizhou, China","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13002-020-00396-y","abstract":"The Buyi (Bouyei) people in Qianxinan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Southwest Guizhou, China, have used medicinal plants and traditional remedies for ethnoveterinary practices, such as treating domestic animals during livestock breeding, since ancient times.

This study aimed to identify the plants used in their traditional ethnoveterinary practices, and to propose suggestions for future conservation and sustainable use of this knowledge.Ethnobotanical fieldwork was conducted in 19 villages/townships in Qianxinan Prefecture between 2017 and 2018. Data were collected from the local Buyi people through semi-structured interviews and participatory observations. The informant consensus factor (FIC) and use reports (URs) were utilized to evaluate the consent of the current ethnoveterinary practices among the local communities, and 83 informants were interviewed during the field investigations. Plant samples and voucher specimens were collected for taxonomic identification.A total of 122 plant species, belonging to 60 families and 114 genera, were recorded as being used in ethnoveterinary practices by the Buyi people. The most used ethnoveterinary medicinal plant (EMP) parts included the roots, whole plant, and bulb, and the most common preparation methods included decoction, crushing, and boiling. Some EMPs, such as Quisqualis indica and Paris polyphylla, have special preparation methods. The informant consensus factor (FIC) and use reports (URs) of the EMP species were analyzed. Twenty EMP species with the highest URs were noted as having particular importance in the daily lives of Buyi people in Qianxinan Prefecture.In this study, we identified traditional ethnoveterinary knowledge of the medicinal plants among the Buyi communities in Qianxinan Prefecture. This knowledge has previously been limited to local vets, herders, and aged community members.

Temozolomide (TMZ) is the current standard chemotherapy for glioma, but tumors usually become resistant and recur. So far, no effective therapy for TMZ-resistant glioma is available. Natural plant antimicrobial solution (PAMs) is a Chinese herbal medicine which has been used for decades without toxicity and has multiple medical functions including anti- inflammatory effects. Here, we report the effects of PAMs on glioblastoma growth.The growth of TMZ -sensitive (U251S),-resistant (U251R) human glioma cells, and mouse glioma cell line GL-26 were assessed by MTS colorimetric assay, colony formation, and cell migration assays.Male C57BL/6 mice were implanted subcutaneously or intracranial with luciferase-positive mouse glioma GL-26 cells and treated with vehicle; MAO A inhibitor clorgyline (10 mg/kg); TMZ (1 mg/kg); PAMs (48 mg/kg) alone or in combination with TMZ (1 mg/kg) for 14 days. At the end of the treatment, mice were sacrificed, MAO A catalytic activity in tumors was measured, and tumor sizes were determined by imaging and weight.These results show that PAMs inhibits MAO A catalytic activity in all three glioma cell lines studied U251S, U251R, and GL-26. PAMs reduced glioma growth and has greater effects in combination with low dose of TMZ than PAMS or TMZ alone in all three cell lines as shown by MTS, colony formation, and cell migration assays. Using the subcutaneous or intracranial GL-26 glioma mouse model, PAMs reduced the tumor growth and MAO A activity, similar to the MAO A inhibitor clorgyline. Combining PAMs with non-toxic dose TMZ increased survival to a greater extent than those of PAMs or TMZ alone.This is the first study which suggests that PAMs alone or co-administration with low doses of TMZ may be a potential adjuvant to reduce the toxicity of TMZ and to abrogate drug resistance for the effective treatment of glioma.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:30.029Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:30.029Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774a64d83dcf45b365226","title":"Ethnobotany, ethnopharmacology, and phytochemistry of traditional medicinal plants used in the management of symptoms of tuberculosis in East Africa: a systematic review","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41182-020-00256-1","abstract":"Many studies on the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) using herbal medicines have been undertaken in recent decades in East Africa.

Only 36 medicinal plants (18.5%) have been screened for antimycobacterial activity. Out of these, 31 (86.1%) were reported to be bioactive with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 47 to 12,500 μg/ml. Most tested plant extracts were found to have acceptable acute toxicity profiles with cytotoxic concentrations on normal mammalian cells greater than 200 μg/ml. The most commonly reported phytochemicals were flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, saponins, cardiac glycosides, and phenols. Only Tetradenia riparia, Warburgia ugandensis, and Zanthoxylum leprieurii have further undergone isolation and characterization of the pure bioactive compounds.East Africa has a rich diversity of medicinal plants that have been reported to be effective in the management of symptoms of TB. More validation studies are required to promote the discovery of antimycobacterial drugs and to provide evidence for standardization of herbal medicine use.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:30.029Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:30.029Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774a64d83dcf45b365227","title":"Efficacy and safety of TCM combined with chemotherapy for SCLC: a systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00432-020-03353-0","abstract":"Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), but chemotherapy resistance and adverse reactions remain major problems.

In vitro antidiabetic property of MEWL was revealed by α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition assays. To explore in vivo antidiabetic properties of MEWL, diabetes was induced in Swiss albino mice by intraperitoneal injection of alloxan at dose of 80 mg/kg body weight (BW). All Swiss albino mice (normal mice and diabetic mice) were divided into five groups and orally treated with normal pellet diet and water (normal control and diabetic control), glibenclamide 5 mg/kg BW and MEWL (100 and 200 mg/kg BW). Effects of MEWL on blood glucose levels, activity of liver function enzymes associated with diabetes and serum levels of lipid parameters were evaluated.In α-amylase inhibition assay, 48.39% inhibition in the activity of α-amylase was observed at 500 μg/ml concentration of MEWL. Moreover, 39.37% inhibition of α-glucosidase activity was observed at 10 μg/ml concentration of MEWL. The results of in vivo antidiabetic assays showed that MEWL significantly (p < 0.01) decreased blood glucose level and ameliorated parameters of lipid profile (TG, TC, LDL, VLDL and HDL) in diabetic mice.

Data was extracted from each review and Plain Language Summaries assessed for content, consistency and readability. Interventions reported in surveys and in Cochrane reviews were compared and effectiveness of each assessed.Surveys from 10 countries reported a variety of self-care interventions, 17 of which appeared in 2 or more surveys and which included dietary supplements, herbal medicines, mind-body therapies and various forms of exercise. Twenty-two reviews and 5 protocols on potential self-care interventions were identified, the majority in depression. Twelve interventions were judged effective or promising, most with small effect sizes. Readability of summaries was highly variable: half were written at college/university level. Several commonly used approaches were not covered by Cochrane reviews.This study has revealed the interventions currently used by the general public which are judged effective or promising based on Cochrane reviews. Some disparity is highlighted between interventions used in practice and the availability of reliable evidence, and in the presentation of effectiveness and safety.

Childhood vulnerability to recurrent illness, and death, is linked to their families’ situations and ability to make choices and act (their agency). We examined vulnerability and agency across treatment-seeking journeys for acutely ill children and considered the implications for policy and practice.A qualitative sub-study was embedded within the prospective CHAIN Network cohort study, which is investigating mechanisms of inpatient and post-hospital discharge mortality among acutely ill young children across a spectrum of nutritional status. Primary data were collected from household members of 20 purposively selected cohort children over 18 months through formal interviews (total n = 74), complemented by informal discussions and observations. Data were analysed using narrative and thematic approaches.Treatment-seeking pathways were often long and complex, particularly for children diagnosed as severely malnourished. Family members’ stories reveal that children’s carers, usually mothers, navigate diverse challenges related to intersecting vulnerabilities at individual, household and facility levels. Specific challenges include the costs of treatment-seeking, confusing and conflicting messaging on appropriate care and nutrition, and poor continuity of care. Strong power inequities were observed between family members and health staff, with many mothers feeling blamed for their child’s condition. Caregivers’ agency, as demonstrated in decision-making and actions, often drew on the social support of others but was significantly constrained by their situation and broader structural drivers.To support children’s care and recovery, health systems must be more responsive to the needs of families facing multiple and interacting vulnerabilities. Reducing incurred treatment costs, improving interpersonal quality of care, and strengthening continuity of care across facilities is essential. Promising interventions need to be co-designed with community representatives and health providers and carefully tested for unintended negative consequences and potential for sustainable scale-up.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:33.395Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-20T15:26:33.395Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6774a94d83dcf45b36522d","title":"The association between airborne pollen monitoring and sensitization in the hot desert climate","link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13601-020-00339-6","abstract":"Pollen is a major cause of allergic respiratory diseases.

In 2013, an integrated ANC program was implemented in western Kenya to promote ANC visits by addressing both supply- and demand-side factors. Supply-side interventions included nurse training and supplies for obstetric emergencies and neonatal resuscitation. Demand-side interventions included SMS text messages with appointment reminders and educational contents, group education sessions, and vouchers to purchase health products.To explore pregnant mothers’ experiences with the intervention, ANC visits, and delivery, we conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) at pre- and post-intervention.

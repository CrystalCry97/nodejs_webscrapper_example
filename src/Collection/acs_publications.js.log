By taking advantage of the thermolysis of N,O-acetal to generate the requisite N-acyl-1-azahexatriene species, we eventually realized the biomimetic Mannich macrocyclization, from which all of the macrocyclic lankacidins can be conquered by orchestrated desilylation. The reassignments of the reported structures of isolankacidinol (7 to 10) and the discovery of a recently isolated “lankacyclinol” found to be in fact 2,18-bis-epi-lankacyclinol (72), unraveled the previously underappreciated chemical diversity exhibited by the enzymatic macrocyclization. In addition, the facile elimination/decarboxylation/protonation process for the depletion of C1 under basic conditions resembling a physiological environment may implicate more undiscovered natural products with variable C2/C18 diastereoisomers (i.e., 62, 73, and 75). The notable aspect provided by a biomimetic strategy is significantly reducing the step count compared with the two previous entries to macrocyclic lankacidins.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:56:57.381Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:56:57.381Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f7207c9a5b0c411adfa407b","title":"A Near-Infrared Fluorescence MOF Nanoprobe for Adenosine Triphosphate-Guided Imaging in Colitis","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.0c13003","abstract":"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is mainly produced in mitochondria and plays important role in lots of pathological process such as colitis. Unfortunately, to date, few suitable fluorescence probe is developed for monitoring ATP level in colitis. Herein, a fluorescence nanoprobe named NIR@ZIF-90 is proposed and prepared by encapsulating a rhodamine-based near-infrared dyes (NIR) into zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-90). The nanoprobe is non-fluorescent because the emission of NIR is suppressed by the encapsulation. While, in the present of ATP, the framework of ZIF-90 is dissembled to release NIR and thus NIR fluorescence at 750 nm is observed. The nanoprobe shows high sensitivity to ATP with 72-fold increase and excellent selectivity to ATP over other nucleotides. Moreover, with low cytotoxicity and good mitochondria-targeted ability, NIR@ZIF-90 is used to image ATP in colorectal cancer cells (HCT116). In addition, due to the NIR emission, the nanoprobe is further performed to successfully monitor ATP level in a colitis mouse model. To the best of our knowledge, the nanoprobe is the first example to study colitis in vivo by the guide of ATP, which will provide an efficient tool for understanding colitis.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:56:57.381Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:56:57.381Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f7207c9a5b0c411adfa407c","title":"Total Structure Determination of the Largest Alkynyl-Protected FCC Gold Nanocluster Au110 and the Study on its Ultrafast Excited-State Dynamics","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.0c07397","abstract":"Great attention has been paid to nanoclusters having face-centered-cubic (FCC) metal kernels, because of the similarity of metal packing to bulk gold.

Curcumin (CMN) has been well-established for anticancer activity against variety of cancers with an ability to eliminate CSCs. In spite of its extensive therapeutic potential, the clinical applicability is impeded due to its highly hydrophobic nature. In this study we developed CMN loaded hybrid lipid nanocapsules (CMN-nHLCs) of three sizes (25, 75 and 150 nm) with 4% (w/w) loading capacity using our low temperature (LT) method. Molecular interaction between different ingredients using FTIR analysis shows self-arrangement of ingredients into CMN loaded nHLCs without any chemical bonding.

CMN-nHLCs show ~2.5 fold enhanced anticancer efficacy compared to free CMN in breast cancer cells (non-bCSCs) and breast cancer stem like cells (bCSCs). CMN-nHLCs are effectively internalized into MCF-7 cells (non-bCSCs and bCSCs), and cause significant reduction in their mammosphere size/number and stemness. nHLCs provide improved physicochemical properties of CMN, and superior anticancer efficacy by co-eradiating both non-bCSCs and bCSCs, suggesting a promising candidature of CMN-nHLCs for breast cancer treatment.

However, the dependence of HIN on the nature of the mineral surface ions is still largely unexplored due to the complexity of mineral surfaces. Because the K+ on the atomically flat (001) surface of mica can be readily replaced by different cations through ion exchange, muscovite mica was selected; its simple nature provides a very straightforward system that can serve as the model for investigating the effects of mineral surface ions on HIN. Our experiments show that the surface (001) of H+-exchanged mica displays markedly higher HIN efficiencies than that of Na-/K-mica. Vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy reveals that H-mica induces substantially less orientation ordering than Na-/K-mica within the contact water layer at the interface. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the HIN efficiency of mica depends on the positional arrangement and orientation of the interfacial water. The formation of the hexagonal ice Ih basal-type structure in the first water layer atop the mica surface facilitates HIN, which is determined by the size of the protruding ions atop the mica surface and by the surface adsorption energy. The orienta-tional distribution is optimal for HIN when 25% of the water molecules in the first water layer atop the mica surface have one OH group pointing up and 25% have one OH group pointing down, which, in turn, is determined by the surface charge distribution.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:56:57.381Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:56:57.381Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f7207c9a5b0c411adfa4081","title":"Potential Modulation by EGCG and its Metabolites of Human NAD[P]H-Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) – A Systematic Computational Study","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.9b00450","abstract":"At high doses, green tea extracts and green tea’s major active constituent, (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), despite their generally perceived health benefits, have been suspected to cause hepatotoxicity in certain human population. It has been reported that o-quinone metabolites of gallic acid or EGCG are causative agents for this hepatotoxicity. However, no experimental information is available at the molecular level on the possible role of NQO1 in the detoxification of EGCG and its metabolites, including reactive intermediates. In the present study, we investigated the possibility of NQO1 inhibition by EGCG and its metabolites by studying their interaction profiles and binding mechanism at the active site of NQO1 using molecular docking, binding free energy calculations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The binding free energy calculations showed that some metabolites exhibited strong predicted binding affinity and found that the binding orientation of the EGCG metabolites overlapped with that of dicoumarol found in an NQO1 X-ray crystal structure. The results suggest that these metabolites may act as strong NQO1 inhibitors, highlighting the need for experimental validation of this with appropriate biological methods. The Prime MM-GBSA computed average binding free energies after MD simulations of 1, 2, 24, 31, and 33 revealed that these compounds highly favored van der Waals and Coulombic interactions with NQO1. In addition, the MD results revealed that selected EGCG metabolites formed a stable and strong complex with NQO1, with amino acids W105, Y126, Y128, H161, F178, H194, F232, and F236 being critical for potential NQO1 binding.

Through one-step assembly process, tFNA is synthesized via four single stranded DNAs with three short sequences complementary to the other sequence of another single strand. Characterizations including polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering measurement show tFNA as a pyramid-like nanostructure with the size of around 10 nm. Feathered with intrinsic biocompatibility and satisfactory cellular membrane permeability, the first generation of tFNA shows promising capacities in regulating cell biological behavior, promoting tissue regeneration and immunomodulation. Along with excellent editability and relative biostability in complicated conditions, tFNA could be modified via hanging functional domains on the vertex or side arm, and incorporating small-molecular-weight drugs to form the second generation, for reversing multidrug resistance in tumor cells or microorganisms, target therapy, anticancer and antibacterial treatments.

The morphology and surface properties of the final dry products/microparticles obtained after the drying process are strongly influenced by the parameters of the initial aerosol droplet composition and the drying conditions. In particular, the final dry microparticle morphology can be dependent on the dimensionless Péclet number (Pe), which expresses the relative competition between the diffusion of the dispersed particles within the droplet and the rate of solvent loss via evaporation. In this work, we examine how control over the gas phase drying conditions and initial aerosol droplet composition can be used to influence the aerosol droplet drying kinetics in the gas phase for a range of Péclet numbers. We used a single-particle levitation instrument, the electrodynamic balance, to measure the drying kinetics of colloidal silica droplets (0.10 - 0.60 % v/v) under controlled gas phase drying conditions of temperature (263 - 326 K) and relative humidity (0 - 90 %) and obtained Péclet numbers ranging from 4.05 - 184.5 We demonstrate that, for aerosol droplets with initially low feed colloid concentrations and within the constant evaporation regime, the starting composition does not strongly influence the solvent evaporation rate with the included nanoparticles (NPs) acting as spectators. However, the gas phase drying conditions, temperature, and relative humidity, directly influence the droplet drying kinetics and the final dry microparticle properties. With a priori knowledge of the droplet drying kinetics from the single droplet measurements, we further demonstrate the possibility of tailoring the morphology of the dried microparticles. Dried silica microparticles collected at Pe = 23.8 had dense spherical morphologies whiles those at the highest Pe = 180.0 had crumpled surface morphologies with a transition in morphology between these limiting Pe values. Our results extend the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms controlling the drying of aerosol droplets in colloidal suspensions across a wide range of application areas extending from spray drying, to the drying of respiratory fluid droplets containing bacteria and viruses, and the drying of atmospheric aerosol droplets.

Furthermore, thanks to the hepatocyte targeting moiety (galactose) and the interplay of surface charge and size of nanoparticles, the SPN is able to enter into asialoglycoprotein-receptor positive HepG2 cells and further locate at lysosomes, successfully enabling accurate HClO detection in lysosomes of HepG2 cells. This study demonstrates that the versatile SPN can provide more precise dual targeting and accurate molecular imaging.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:14.558Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:14.558Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f7207daa5b0c411adfa408c","title":"A Potent and Selective Human Prostaglandin F (FP) Receptor Antagonist (BAY-6672) for the Treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00834","abstract":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and devastating chronic lung disease of unknown etiology.

It was hypothesized that TTME possessed antioxidant potential and can ameliorate Parkinson’s disease (PD) via modulation of α-synuclein, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), TNF-α, and IL-1β. To test this hypothesis, in silico and in vivo studies were performed. The PD model in rats was prepared by giving haloperidol, 1 mg/kg, i.p. Rats were divided into six groups: control, disease control, standard, and treatment groups receiving TTME orally at 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg dose levels for 21 days. Behavioral observations and biochemical analyses were done. The TTME modulatory effect on mRNA expression of α-synuclein, AChE, TNF-α, and interleukins in the brain homogenate was estimated by RT-PCR. Compounds detected in HPLC analysis disrupted the catalytic triad of AChE in in silico studies. Behavioral observations showed significant (p < 0.05) improvement in a reversal of catatonia, muscular strength, locomotor functions, stride length, and exploration in a dose-dependent manner (1000 >300 >100 mg/kg) of PD rats. Endogenous antioxidant enzyme levels CAT, SOD, GSH, and GPx were significantly restored at a high dose (p < 0.05) with a notable (p < 0.05) decrease in the MDA level in TTME-treated groups. TTME at a high dose significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the level of acetylcholinesterase. RT-PCR results are showing down-regulation in the mRNA expression levels of IL-1β, α -synuclein, TNF-α, and AChE in TTME-treated groups compared to the disease control group, indicating neuroprotection.

The latter is key for a reliable comparison of metabolic profiles and for unknown biomarker identification that is complementary to high resolution MS/MS. In this work, we present the results of a Metabo-ring trial involving 16 CE-MS platforms among 13 different laboratories spanning two continents. The goal was to assess the reproducibility and identification capability of CE-MS by employing effective electrophoretic mobility (µeff) as the key parameter in comparison to the relative migration time (RMT) approach. For this purpose, a representative cationic metabolite mixture in water, pretreated human plasma and urine samples spiked with the same metabolite mixture, were used and distributed for analysis by all laboratories. The µeff was determined for all metabolites spiked into each sample. The background electrolyte (BGE) was prepared and employed by each participating lab following the same protocol. All other parameters (capillary, interface, injection volume, voltage ramp, temperature, capillary conditioning and rinsing procedure, etc.) were left to the discretion of the contributing labs. The results revealed that the reproducibility of the µeff for 20 out of the 21 model compounds was below 3.1% vs. 10.9% for RMT, regardless of the huge heterogeneity in experimental conditions and platforms across the thirteen labs.

Indeed, TMG-SYNPHOS forms a copper complex that catalyzes hydroboration of 1,1-disubtituted alkenes with high levels of enantioselectivity, even when the two substituents are both primary alkyl groups. In addition, copper catalysts bearing ligands possessing germanyl groups were much more active for hydroboration than one derived from DTBM-SEGPHOS, a ligand containing 2,5-di-tert-butyl groups and widely used for copper-catalyzed hydrofunctionalization. This observation led to the identification of DTMGM-SEGPHOS, a bisphosphine ligand bearing 3,5-bis(trimethylgermanyl)-4-methoxyphenyl groups as the substituents on the phosphorus, as a new ligand that forms a highly active catalyst for hydroboration of unactivated 1,2-disubstituted alkenes, a class of substrates that has not readily undergone copper-catalyzed hydroboration previously. Computational studies revealed that the enantioselectivity and catalytic efficiency of the germanyl-substituted ligands is higher than that of the silyl and tert-butyl substituted analogs because of attractive dispersion interactions between the bulky trimethyl-germanyl groups on the ancillary ligand and the alkene substrate and that Pauli repulsive interactions tended to de-crease enantioselectivity.

The results revealed that the combination of BBM and SORA could synergistically inhibit the growth of two HCC cell lines and promoted their apoptosis. Mechanistically, our results showed that BBM exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the basal and IL-6-induced STAT3 activation of HCC cell lines. In addition, the combined treatment of BBM and SORA synergistically suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 and knockdown of STAT3 abolished the sensitization effect of BBM, indicating that BBM’s sensitization effect is mainly mediated by its inhibition of STAT3.

It is a heterogeneous surfactant containing a distribution of fatty acid esters which are subject to hydrolytic degradation, generating free fatty acids (FFAs). The FFAs can form visible or sub-visible particles in drug product on stability. A previous FFA solubility model, developed by our group, predicts solubility limits for the three most prevalent FFA degradation products of PS20: lauric, myristic and palmitic acid. The model takes into account two formulation parameters, pH and PS20 concentration, and their effect on FFA solubility. This work identifies a third parameter that has an impact on FFA solubility: PS20 ester distribution. When PS20 is hydrolytically degraded, the ester distribution of the remaining surfactant changes on stability. Ester distribution is known to influence the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of PS20 such that the mono-esters have a much higher CMC compared to the higher order esters (HOE). We hypothesize that as PS20 degrades, the CMC changes, affecting the proportion of PS20 that is present in micelles and capable of sequestering and solubilizing FFAs in these micelles. Here, PS20 was separated into mono-ester, HOE, and polyol fractions. The mono-ester and HOE fractions were mixed together to generate mock degradation profiles of hydrolytically degraded PS20. FFA solubility was measured as a function of the concentration of these mock-degraded (MD) PS20s. The results indicate that ester distribution does have an impact on FFA solubility, especially at higher MD PS20 concentrations. HOEs solubilize up to 30 μg/mL more lauric acid than an equivalent amount of mono-esters at a MD PS20 level of 0.06% w/v. With the addition of % HOE peak area fraction as a third parameter representing the ester distribution of PS20, the refined FFA solubility model more accurately predicts FFA solubility in protein formulations at 5°C. The refined model suggests that drug products containing trace levels of host cell proteins (HCPs) that preferentially degrade HOEs of PS20 are at a higher risk of particle formation.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:37.456Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:37.456Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f7207f1a5b0c411adfa40ac","title":"Unveiling the Synergistic Role of Oxygen Functional Groups in the Graphene-Mediated Oxidation of Glutathione","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.0c11539","abstract":"This is the first report of an atomic-scale direct oxidation mechanism of the thiol group in glutathione (GSH) by epoxides on graphene oxide (GO) at the room temperature.

To guide the design of improved nanomaterials for targeted performance, one can use mechanistic insights into the interactions between capping agents and nanoparticles. Here, we employ density functional theory (DFT), reactive force-field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) simulations, and optical spectroscopy to study the interactions between salicylate, as a model capping agent, and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles. We find that salicylate strongly interacts with the nanoparticle via the formation of O-Zn bonds in a distorted six-membered coordination ring structure. We describe the mechanisms of capping of ZnO nanoparticle by salicylate via three different schemes. Simulations indicate that salicylate undergoes dissociative adsorption at the highly active surface Zn sites via a hydrogen transfer process, thereby forming a tridentate configuration. The water mediated interaction also facilitates the dissociative adsorption leading to two salicylate O atoms coordinating with a surface Zn atom, while the other salicylate O atom bonds with another surface Zn atom. For molecular adsorption, binding free energies indicate salicylate binds more strongly to ZnO, often in a bidentate configuration, than water does. The formation of the salicylate-ZnO complex is substantiated by UV-visible and Fourier-transform infrared spectra. We find that the C=O stretching mode of salicylate becomes softened when it interacts with the nanoparticle, suggesting chemisorption of salicylate on ZnO. While DFT predicts strong interaction between salicylate and ZnO, ReaxFF MD simulation indicates the moderate interaction between these two components in aqueous solution. Water molecules in close contact with the nanoparticle surface undergo dissociation, thus resulting in surface hydroxyl, a reactive oxygen species that may influence the nanoparticle’s catalytic properties. The atomic-level information provided here can guide the selection process of salicylate as an appropriate agent for ZnO nanoparticle synthesis when strong interactions of particles with capping agents are required.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:37.456Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:37.456Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f7207f1a5b0c411adfa40ad","title":"A phytantriol-based cubosome formulation as an antimicrobial against lipopolysaccharide-deficient Gram-negative bacteria","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.0c13309","abstract":"Treatment of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections increasingly relies on last-line antibiotics, such as polymyxins, with the urgent need for discovery of new antimicrobials.

However, the presence of surfactants can influence the lipase activity and also cause competitive adsorption, resulting in a removal of lipase from the interface or its conformational changes in the solution bulk. Here we have studied the dynamics of competitive adsorption and interfacial elasticity of mixed solutions containing lipase and the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), respectively, at the water–air interface. The experiments were performed with a special coaxial double capillary setup for drop bulk–interface exchange developed for the drop profile analysis tensiometer PAT with two protocols: sequential and simultaneous adsorption of single components and mixed systems. The results in terms of dynamic surface tension and dilational visco-elasticity illustrate fast and complete desorption of a pre-adsorbed CTAB and SDS layers via sub-phase exchange with a buffer solution. In contrast, the pre-adsorbed lipase layer cannot be removed either by SDS or CTAB from the interface during drop bulk exchange with a buffer solution due to the unfolding process and conformation evolution of the protein molecules at the interface. In the opposite case, lipase can remove pre-adsorbed SDS and CTAB. The dynamic surface tension and visco-elasticity data measured before and after sub-phase exchange show joint adsorption of lipase and CTAB in the form of complexes, while SDS is adsorbed in competition with lipase. The results are in good correlation with the determined surface charges of the lipase gained by computational simulations which show a dominant negatively charged surface for lipase that can interact with the cationic CTAB while partial positively charged regions are observed for the interaction with the anionic SDS.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:46.735Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:46.735Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f7207faa5b0c411adfa40b2","title":"On-demand and tunable dual wavelength release of antibody using light-responsive hydrogelsOn-demand and tunable dual wavelength release of antibody using light-responsive hydrogels","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsabm.0c00823","abstract":"There has been an increased interest in the use of protein therapeutics, especially antibodies, for the treatment of a variety of diseases due to their high specificity to tissues and biological pathways of interest. However, the use of antibodies can be hindered by physical aggregation, degradation, and diffusion when injected in vivo leading to the need for antibody-releasing depots for the controlled and localized delivery within tissues of interest. Here, we investigated photolabile hydrogel chemistries for creating on-demand and tunable antibody release profiles. Innovative, scalable synthetic procedures were established and applied for fabricating hydrogels with nitrobenzyl (NB) and coumarin (CMR) photolabile crosslinks that responded to clinically relevant doses of long-wavelength UV and short-wavelength visible light. This synthetic procedure includes a route to make a CMR linker possessing two functional handles at the same ring position with water-stable bonds. The photocleavage properties of NB and CMR crosslinked hydrogels were characterized, as well as their potential for translational studies by degradation through pig skin, a good human skin mimic. The mechanism of hydrogel degradation, bulk versus surface eroding, was determined to be dependent on the wavelength of light utilized and the molar absorptivity of the different photolabile linkers, providing a facile means for altering protein release upon hydrogel degradation. Further, the encapsulation and on-demand release of a model monoclonal antibody was demonstrated, highlighting the ability to control antibody release from these hydrogels through the application of light while retaining its bioactivity. In particular, the newly designed CMR hydrogels undergo surface erosion-based protein release using visible light, which is more commonly used clinically. Overall, this work establishes scalable syntheses and relevant pairings of formulation-irradiation conditions for designing on-demand and light-responsive material systems that provide controlled, tunable release of bioactive proteins toward addressing barriers to preclinical translation of light-based materials and ultimately improving therapeutic regimens.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:46.735Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:46.735Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f7207faa5b0c411adfa40b3","title":"Orange-Emitting ZnSe:Mn2+ Quantum Dots as Nanoprobes for Macrophages","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsanm.0c02242","abstract":"The biocompatibility, bio-nano interaction, uptake efficiency, and entry pathway of luminescent nanomaterials are the key factors to understand for developing an efficient bionanoprobe.

For this purpose, highly intense orange-emitting activator Mn2+ ion doped ZnSe QDs were synthesized via high-temperature organometallic method and rendered water-soluble by ligand exchange approach. The morphological and physicochemical characterizations displayed the ultra-small zinc-blend cubic crystal structure of QDs with an elliptical shape nanocrystals and average diameter of 4 nm. The luminescent nanomaterials exhibited orange emission centered at 584 nm under excitation at 385 nm. The biocompatibility, time-dependent cellular uptake, and the uptake mechanism of QDs were studied in Raw 264.7 macrophages, accomplishing by various cytotoxicity assays, CytoViva® hyperspectral enhanced dark-field and dual-mode fluorescence (DMF) microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. The cytotoxicity study did not confirm any noticeable deleterious effect of QDs within incubation for 6 hours. The fluorescence images of cells incubated with QDs showed efficient emission, which is a manifestation that QDs are photochemicaly stable in the intracellular environment. The cellular uptake findings demonstrated that the QDs were predominantly internalized via clathrin-and caveolae-mediated pathways. After the uptake, QDs aggregates appeared inside the vesicles in the cytoplasm, and their number and size gradually increased as a function of time. Nevertheless, the fluorescent QDs presented remarkable colloidal stability in various media, biocompatibility within the designated time, efficient time-dependent uptake, and distinct entry pathway in RAW macrophages, suggesting promising candidates to explore for the development of future bionanoprobes.

As a model peptide, we used GHWYYRCW, which is a functional peptide that inhibits α-amylase derived from human pancreatic juice. First, training data were acquired. 153 peptides were prepared in which 1 amino acid in GHWYYRCW was replaced, to construct a 1-amino acid substitution coverage peptide library. The inhibitory activity of each peptide against α-amylase and α-glucosidase was evaluated. Second, random forest (RF) regression analysis was performed using 120 variables, and the enzyme inhibitory activity of the peptide was related to the physicochemical properties. The constructed model had many features describing the charge of the amino acid (isoelectric point and pK2). Then, high inhibitory (HI) peptides were predicted using a library of peptides with 2- or 3-amino acid substitution as test data, which were called HI2 and HI3 peptides. As results, the first or seventh amino acid of the HI2 peptide has been replaced with Arg, Trp, or Tyr. We found that all 30 HI2 peptides had significantly higher activity than the original sequence (100%) and 26 of the 30 HI3 peptides were significantly active (86.7%). However, the actual inhibitory activity of the HI3 peptides were improved to a lesser extent. The docking simulation clarified that CDOCKER energy decrease was roughly correlated to the inhibitory activity. The machine learning-based predictive model was a promising tool for design of substituted peptide with high actual values and it was assumed that the advanced model which forecasts the interaction index such as CDOCKER energy substituting with the inhibitory activity would be used to design HI peptides, even in the case of the HI3 peptides.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:46.735Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:46.735Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f7207faa5b0c411adfa40b6","title":"Chelator Regulation of In Situ Calcium Availability to Enable Spray-Dry Microencapsulation in Cross-Linked Alginates","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.0c02030","abstract":"A recently patented one-step in situ cross-linked alginate microencapsulation (CLAM) by spray-drying (i.e., the UC Davis CLAMs technology) can overcome the high cost of scale-up that limits commercial applications.

Here, we demonstrate an alternate one-step spray-dry CLAMs process using pH-responsive chelation of calcium. The “Chelate CLAMs” process is an improvement over the patented process that controls ion availability based on pH-responsive solubility of the calcium salt. Hyaluronic acid was encapsulated in CLAMs to minimize swelling and release in aqueous formulations. CLAMs with 61% (d.b.) hyaluronic acid (HA-CLAMs) demonstrated restricted plumping, limited water absorption capacity, and reduced leaching, retaining up to 49% hyaluronic acid after 2 h in water. Alternatively, “Chelate HA-CLAMs” formed by the improved process exhibited nearly full retention of hyaluronic acid over 2 h in water and remained visibly insoluble after 1 year of storage in water at 4 °C.

Endogenous ligands, such as hormones and neurotransmitters, bind to the orthosteric site, while synthetic ligands may bind to orthosteric or allosteric sites, which has become a focal point in drug discovery. Usually, such allosteric modulators bind to a protein non-competitively with its endogenous ligand or substrate. The growing interest in allosteric modulators has resulted in a substantial increase of these entities and their features such as binding data in chemical libraries and databases. Although this data surge fuels research focused on allosteric modulators, binding data is unfortunately not always clearly indicated as being allosteric or orthosteric. Therefore, allosteric binding data is difficult to retrieve from databases that contain a mixture of allosteric and orthosteric compounds. This decreases model performance when statistical methods, such as machine learning models, are applied. In previous work we generated an allosteric data subset of ChEMBL release 14. In the current study an improved text mining approach is used to retrieve the allosteric and orthosteric binding types from the literature in ChEMBL release 22. Moreover, convolutional deep neural networks were constructed to predict the binding types of compounds for class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Temporal split validation showed the model predictiveness with MCC = 0.54, sensitivity allosteric = 0.54, and sensitivity orthosteric = 0.94.

Often from human origin, these micropollutants build up in the environment because organisms lack the mechanisms to metabolize these substances, which cause negative health, ecological, and economic effects. Adsorption-based remediation processes for these compounds often rely on activated carbon materials. However, activated carbons are ineffective against certain MPs, exhibit low removal efficiencies in the presence of common aqueous matrix constituents, and require energy-intensive activation and regeneration processes. To overcome the deficiencies of traditional technologies, novel adsorbents based on molecular receptors offer promising alternative solutions. This Account describes the recent development of polymer adsorbents based on molecular receptors for removing trace organic chemicals from water. Polymer networks based on molecular receptors have high binding affinities for many MPs but, unlike activated carbons, have a specific molecule-binding mechanism that prevents these polymers from being fouled by matrix constituents such as natural organic matter. The size and hydrophobic pocket of the β-cyclodextrin receptor preferentially adsorbs target molecules such as organic micropollutants in the presence of matrix constituents, and the nature of the cross-linker tunes the binding affinity and selectivity of the adsorbent for specific classes of MPs, including those of varying charge and hydrophobicity. β-cyclodextrin polymers also exhibit rapid adsorption kinetics and are easily regenerated. This Account details β-cyclodextrin polymers made with three different cross-linkers, including a polymer that is postsynthetically transformed from a negatively charged polymer to a positively charged polymer to invert the polymer’s micropollutant adsorption profile. Morphological constraints have so far limited these cross-linked polymers’ ability to be used in commercial applications, but two methods to create larger and more uniformly sized particles for use in flow-through applications are described here. β-Cyclodextrin polymers are useful for trapping organic micropollutants such as bisphenol A, perfluorooctanoic acid, and many kinds of pharmaceuticals and pesticides, but their binding pockets are too large to capture micropollutants that are small or of high polarity. Other molecular receptors such as resorcinarene cavitands can target lower-molecular-weight MPs, including halomethane disinfection byproducts and industrial solvents, that are not bound strongly by β-cyclodextrins. These materials demonstrate the potential of expanding the library of polymers based on molecular receptors. Overall, these emerging adsorbents show promise for the removal of legacy and emerging MPs from water, as well as the ability to rationally tune the adsorbent’s structure to target the most persistent and toxic MPs.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:46.735Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:46.735Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f720800a5b0c411adfa40ba","title":"Solid Carbonation via Ultrapermeable PIM-1 Hollow Fiber Membranes for Scalable CO2 Utilization","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c05088","abstract":"A successful changeover to a sustainable energy system that does not add extra CO2 to the atmosphere, a net-zero emissions energy system, is likely to depend on a combination of known technologies enabled by scalable and modular devices.

We here developed a label-free high-throughput mass cytometry method to investigate gold NPs (AuNPs) uptake in unicellular organism (Tetrahymena thermophila) at the single-cell level. The limit of detection for Au is as low as to 6.67 ×10-18 g/cell, which equals to ~ 5.3 5-nm AuNPs. We demonstrated that active engulfment pathways were responsible for the cellular accumulation of AuNPs and T. thermophila could also eliminate the cellular of AuNPs rapidly. The interaction between AuNPs and T. thermophila is highly dependent on the sizes of nanoparticles, i.e. the population of T. thermophila containing AuNPs decreased with the increment of the diameters of AuNPs when exposed to the same mass concentration. For each type of AuNPs, distinct heterogeneous cellular uptake of AuNPs by T. thermophila was observed. Intriguingly, for 5-nm AuNP, even at 0.001 ng/mL, some T. thermophila cells could concentrate AuNPs, indicating a real environmental concern even when water was contaminated by only trace level of NPs.

For these systems, we carried out accurate measurements of water activity at two temperatures (298.15 and 313.15 or 318.15 K) in the whole composition range, boiling temperatures at three pressures (50, 70, and 90 kPa), and freezing temperatures in the water-rich region. The melting temperature and melting enthalpy of the neat glymes were also determined. We correlated our water activity data simultaneously with some related thermal data from the literature using an extended SSF-type excess Gibbs energy (GE) model. The established model descriptions provided not only particularly good fit of the underlying data but, as proven by due comparisons to other results from both the literature and this work, showed a superior performance, extrapolating very well to both higher and lower temperatures. The high-fidelity global modeling also enabled us to present a clear picture of the energetics of the two aqueous glymes.

Since these protrusions are often branched and filamentous in conventional liquid electrolytes, this problem is referred to in the literature as the “dendrite problem”. While solid electrolytes have the potential to solve this problem, protrusions grow in all electrolytes when the current density exceeds a critical value. Fundamentally understanding the formation is necessary to develop a rational approach for increasing the critical current density, but it is challenging due to the complex interplay between electrochemical and material properties. The diameters and heights of protrusions on lithium-metal anodes stabilized by a rigid block copolymer electrolyte were measured in situ by synchrotron hard X-ray microtomography. The diameter of the shorting protrusions increased linearly with increasing electrolyte thickness. Further, a universal linear relationship between protrusion height and diameter of both shorting and non-shorting protrusions was observed.

Most UA preparations demonstrated a much higher dissolution than that of its crystalline form, yet a low drug concentration in plasma due to their less consideration or evaluation for the permeability and metabolism issues. In the current study, a supramolecular co-amorphous system of UA with piperine (PIP) was prepared, and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. In comparison to crystalline UA and UA in physical mixture, such co-amorphous system enhanced solubility (5.3-7 folds in the physiological solution) and dissolution (7-8 folds in the physiological solution within two hours) of UA, and exhibited excellent physical stability under 90-day storage conditions. More importantly, the pharmacokinetic study of co-amorphous UA in rats exhibited 5.8-fold and 2.47-fold improvement in AUC0-∞ value, respectively, compared with its free and mixed crystalline counterparts. In order to further explore the mechanism of such improvement, the molecular interactions of co-amorphous system in the solid state were investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory modeling suggested that intermolecular hydrogen bonds with strong interactions newly formed between UA and PIP after co-amorphization. The in vitro permeability studies across Caco-2 cell monolayer and metabolism studies by rat hepatic microsomes indicated that free PIP significantly increased the permeability of UA and inhibited the enzymatic metabolism of UA by CYP3A4. However, PIP in the co-amorphous combination exhibited a much lower level in the bio-enhancing than its free form arising from the synchronized dissolution characteristic of the preparation (only 60% of PIP released in comparison to its free counterpart in 2 h). The in-situ loop study in rats proposed that the acid-sensitive dissolution in the stomach of the co-amorphous preparation helped to improve the effective free drug concentration, thereby facilitating PIP to play its role in bio-enhancing. The current study offers an exploratory strategy to overcome poor solubility/dissolution, poor permeability and metabolism by cytochrome P450 isozymes of the BCS Ⅳ drug to improve its oral bioavailability.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:52.122Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:57:52.122Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f720800a5b0c411adfa40c1","title":"Challenges and Opportunities of Deferoxamine Delivery for Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, and Intracerebral Hemorrhage","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.0c00474","abstract":"Deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) is an FDA-approved, hexadentate iron chelator routinely used to alleviate systemic iron burden in thalassemia major and sickle cell patients. Iron accumulation in these disease states results from the repeated blood transfusions required to manage these conditions. More recently, iron accumulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease (PD), and secondary injury following Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH). Chelation of brain iron is thus a promising therapeutic strategy for improving behavioral outcome and slowing neurodegeneration in the aforementioned disease states, though the effectiveness of DFO treatment is limited on several accounts. Systemically administered DFO results in non-specific toxicity at high doses, and the drug’s short half-life leads to low patient compliance. Mixed reports of DFO’s ability to cross the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) also appear in literature. These limitations necessitate novel DFO formulations prior to the drug’s widespread use in managing neurodegeneration. Herein, we discuss the various dosing regimens and formulations employed in intranasal or systemic DFO treatment, as well as the physiological and behavioral outcomes observed in animal models of AD, PD, and ICH. The clinical progress of chelation therapy in managing neurodegeneration is also evaluated. Finally, the elimination of intranasally administered particles via the glymphatic system and efflux transporters is discussed. Abundant preclinical evidence suggests that intranasal DFO treatment improves memory retention and behavioral outcome in rodent models of AD, PD, and ICH. Several other biochemical and physiological metrics such as tau phosphorylation, survival of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, and infarct volume, are also positively affected by intranasal DFO treatment. However, dosing regimens are inconsistent across studies and little is known about brain DFO concentration following treatment. Systemic DFO treatment yields similar results, and some complex formulations have been developed to improve permeability across the BBB. However, despite the success in preclinical models, clinical translation is limited with most clinical evidence investigating DFO treatment in ICH patients, where high-dose treatment has proven dangerous and dosing regimens are not consistent across studies. DFO is a strong drug candidate for managing neurodegeneration in the aging population, but before it can be routinely implemented as a therapeutic agent, dosing regimens must be standardized and brain DFO content following drug administration must be understood and controlled via novel formulations.

Therefore, d33 in these Janus transition-metal trichalcogenide (TMTC) bilayers reach more than 4-fold times that of bulk ceramic PZT material (∼268 pm/V). The absence of a horizontal mirror symmetry and the presence of strong spin–orbit coupling cause Rashba spin-splitting in electronic bands in these Janus 2D monolayers, which shows up as an ultrahigh Rashba parameter, αR ∼ 1.1 eV Å. It can be raised to 1.41 eV Å via compressive strain. Most of the 2D materials reported to date mainly show in-plane electric polarization, which severely limits their prospects in piezotronic devices. In this present work, the piezoelectricity shown by the Janus monolayers of group IV TMTCs and their bilayers is significantly higher than the ones generally utilized in the form of three-dimensional bulk piezoelectric solids, for example, α-quartz (d11 = 2.3 pm/V), wurtzite-GaN (d33 = 3.1 pm/V), and wurtzite-AlN (d33 = 5.6 pm/V).

Moreover, these systems can transport protons along hydrogen-bonded networks or proton wires through multiproton PCET. Herein, the nonequilibrium dynamics of both single and double proton transfer in BIP molecules initiated by oxidation are investigated with first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Although these processes are concerted in that no thermodynamically stable intermediate is observed, the simulations predict that they are predominantly asynchronous on the ultrafast time scale. For both systems, the first proton transfer typically occurs ∼100 fs after electron transfer. For the double proton transfer system, typically the second proton transfer occurs hundreds of femtoseconds after the initial proton transfer. A machine learning algorithm was used to identify the key molecular vibrational modes essential for proton transfer: a slow, in-plane bending mode that dominates the overall inner-sphere reorganization, the proton donor–acceptor motion that leads to vibrational coherence, and the faster donor–hydrogen stretching mode. The asynchronous double proton transfer mechanism can be understood in terms of a significant mode corresponding to the two anticorrelated proton donor–acceptor motions, typically decreasing only one donor–acceptor distance at a time. Although these PCET processes appear concerted on the time scale of typical electrochemical experiments, attaching these BIP constructs to photosensitizers may enable the detection of the asynchronicity of the electron and multiple proton transfers with ultrafast two-dimensional spectroscopy.

BIPHEN (with two reinforcing benzo groups in the backbone) was compared to other tetrapyridyls, 2,9-di(pyrid-2-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline (DPP; with one benzo group) and 2,2′:6′,2″:6″,2‴- quaterpyridine (QPY; with no benzo groups), with levels of preorganization BIPHEN > DPP > QPY. Formation constants were determined by following the variation of the intense π → π* transitions in the absorbance spectra of BIPHEN in the presence of metal ion as a function of the pH. The log K1 values show that the increased level of preorganization produced by the two benzo groups, reinforcing the backbone of the BIPHEN ligand, leads to increased complex stability with large metal ions (an ionic radius greater than 0.9 Å) compared to the less preorganized tetrapyridines DPP and QPY. In particular, the large CdII ion [log K1(BIPHEN) = 12.7] shows unusual selectivity over the small ZnII ion [log K1(BIPHEN) = 7.78]. The order of levels of preorganization BIPHEN > DPP > QPY leads to enhanced selectivity for SmIII over GdIII with increased preorganization, which is of interest in relation to separating AmIII from GdIII in the treatment of radioactive waste. AmIII is very close in ionic radius to SmIII, so that the size-based selectivity produced by the enhanced preorganization of BIPHEN should translate into enhanced AmIII/GdIII selectivity. The chelation-enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) effect in BIPHEN complexes is discussed. The CHEF effect in the ZnII complex is somewhat smaller than that for CdII, which is discussed in terms of decreased overlap in the Zn–N bonds formed by the too small ZnII, leading to a partial photoinduced-electron-transfer quenching of fluorescence. The structure of the complex [Cd(BIPHEN)2](ClO4)2 is reported and shows that the Cd–N bonds are largely normal for the unusual 8-coordination observed, except that steric clashes between the terminal pyridyl groups of each of the BIPHEN ligands, and the rest of the orthogonal BIPHEN ligand, lead to some stretching of the outer Cd–N bonds.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:09.091Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:09.091Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f72081ba5b0c411adfa40d4","title":"In vivo metabolism of aristolochic acid I and II in rats is influenced by their co-exposure","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.0c00198","abstract":"The plant extract aristolochic acid (AA), containing aristolochic acid I (AAI) and II (AAII) as major components, causes aristolochic acid nephropathy and Balkan endemic nephropathy, unique renal diseases associated with upper urothelial cancer. Differences in the metabolic activation and detoxification of AAI and AAII and their effects on the metabolism of AAI/AAII mixture in the plant extract might be of great importance for an individual’s susceptibility in the development of AA-mediated nephropathies and malignancies. Here, we investigated in vivo metabolism of AAI and AAII after i.p. administration to Wistar rats as individual compounds and as AAI/AAII mixture using high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Experimental findings were supported by theoretical calculations using density functional theory. We found that exposure to AAI/AAII mixture affected the generation of their oxidative and reductive metabolites formed during Phase I biotransformation and excreted in rat urine. Several Phase II metabolites of AAI and AAII found in the urine of exposed rats were also analysed. Our results indicate that AAI is more efficiently metabolised in rats in vivo than AAII. Whereas AAI is predominantly oxidised during in vivo metabolism, its reduction is the minor metabolic pathway. In contrast, AAII is mainly metabolised by reduction. The oxidative reaction only occurs if aristolactam II, the major reductive metabolite of AAII, is enzymatically hydroxylated, forming aristolactam Ia. In AAI/AAII mixture, the metabolism of AAI and AAII is influenced by the presence of both AAs. For instance, the reductive metabolism of AAI is increased in the presence of AAII while the presence of AAI decreased the reductive metabolism of AAII. These results suggest that increased bioactivation of AAI in the presence of AAII also leads to increased AAI genotoxicity which may critically impact on AAI-mediated carcinogenesis.

However, precise quantum chemistry calculations are most often done either in vacuum neglecting the role of the solvent or using continuum solvent model ignoring its molecular nature. We propose a new method coupling a quantum description of the solute using electronic density functional theory with a classical grand-canonical treatment of the solvent using molecular density functional theory. Unlike previous work, both densities are minimized self consistently, accounting for mutual polarization of the molecular solvent and the solute. The electrostatic interaction is accounted using the full electron density of the solute rather than fitted point charges. The introduced methodology represents a good compromise between the two main strategies to tackle solvation effects in quantum calculation. It is computationally more effective than a direct quantum-mechanics/molecular mechanics coupling, requiring the exploration of many solvent configurations. Compared to continuum methods it retains the full molecular-level description of the solvent. We validate this new framework onto two usual benchmark systems: a water solvated in water and the symmetrical nucleophilic substitution between chloromethane and chloride in water. The prediction for the free energy profiles are not yet fully quantitative compared to experimental data but the most important features are qualitatively recovered. The method provides a detailed molecular picture of the evolution of the solvent structure along the reaction pathway.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:19.118Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:19.118Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f72081ba5b0c411adfa40d6","title":"A Zwitterionic Polypeptide-based Nanodrug Augments pH-Triggered Tumor Targeting via Prolonging Circulation Time and Accelerating Cellular Internalization","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.0c11747","abstract":"To augment the anti-tumor efficacy and minimize the significant side-effects on health organs of chemotherapeutic drugs, a novel albumin-mimicking nanodrug, which is based on zwitterionic poly(glutamatyl lysine-co-cysteine) peptides scaffold, is developed to enhance pH-triggered tumor targeting via prolonging circulation time and accelerating cellular internalization. Results showed that the internalization of the nanodrug by MCF-7 cells is much faster than Doxil and even comparable to free doxorubicin (Dox) at tumor microenvironmental pH 6.7, whereas the internalization by RAW-264.7 cells is only 27.4 ± 7.6% of Doxil at physiological pH 7.4. Moreover, the significantly prolonged circulation time of the ‘stealthy’ nanodrug was also comparable to the long circulating Doxil. As a result, the accumulation of the nanodrug in the tumor is much higher than in the liver and kidney before the circulation half-life, which is significantly different from most other nanodrugs accumulated in the liver and kidney in this time scale. The tumor inhibition rate of the nanodrug was much higher than Doxil (93.2± 3.0 % vs 54.2± 6.5 %) after 18-day treatment while the average bodyweight of mice treated by the nanodrug was 26.9± 6.7 % higher than Doxil.

The algorithm was further applied to SEC chromatograms of samples collected from a pilot-scale ozone–biological activated carbon system. The trimodal AMW distribution of chromatograms was deconvoluted into six components: three from the biopolymer and the other three from humic and low-molecular weight (humic/LMW) substances. The deconvolution process captured the formation of a biopolymer fraction that was not noticeably observed without chemometric deconvolution. Also, the increased level of removal of the lowest-molecular weight fraction at the elevated ozone dose from 4.1 to 6.4 mg of O3/L suggests that ozone enhanced biodegradability selectively for low-molecular weight fractions. The proposed chemometric method can be a useful tool for providing novel insights into SEC chromatogram interpretations. MATLAB-based GUI software for SEC chromatogram deconvolution was developed and is available online.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:24.378Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:24.378Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f720829a5b0c411adfa40e6","title":"Trichothecrotocins D–L, Antifungal Agents from a Potato-Associated Trichothecium crotocinigenumTrichothecrotocins D–L, Antifungal Agents from a Potato-Associated Trichothecium crotocinigenum","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c00695","abstract":"Seven new merosesquiterpenoids, trichothecrotocins D–J (1–7), two new trichothecene sesquiterpenoids, trichothecrotocins K (12) and L (13), and six known compounds (8–11, 14, and 15), were isolated from a potato-associated fungus, Trichothecium crotocinigenum.

Although various types of low-dimensional structures have been developed, fundamental understating of the structure–property relationships for this class of materials is still very limited, and further improvement of their optical properties remains greatly important. Here, we report a significant pressure-induced photoluminescence (PL) enhancement in a one-dimensional hybrid metal halide C4N2H14PbBr4, and the underlying mechanisms are investigated using in situ experimental characterization and first-principles calculations. Under a gigapascal pressure scale, the PL quantum yields (PLQYs) were quantitatively determined to show a dramatic increase from the initial value of 20% at ambient conditions to over 90% at 2.8 GPa. With in situ characterization of photophysical properties and theoretical analysis, we found that the PLQY enhancement was mainly attributed to the greatly suppressed nonradiative decay. Pressure can effectively tune the energy level of self-trapped states and increase the exciton binding energy, which leads to a larger Stokes shift. The resulting highly localized excitons with stronger binding reduce the probability for carrier scattering, to result in the significantly suppressed nonradiative decay. Our findings clearly show that the characteristics of STEs in low-dimensional metal halides can be well-tuned by external pressure, and enhanced optical properties can be achieved.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:33.383Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:33.383Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f720829a5b0c411adfa40e9","title":"Theoretical evaluation of graphene quantum dots on DNA genotoxicity: a combination of density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulation","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c05882","abstract":"Owing to unique morphology, ultra-small lateral sizes and exceptional properties, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) hold great potential in many applications, especially in the field of electrochemical biosensors, bioimaging, drug delivery, gene delivery etc. Its biosafety and potential genotoxicity to human and animal cells is a growing concern in recent years.

In this study, the effect of GQDs on DNA damaging has been evaluated by a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory. Our results demonstrates that the DNA damaging mechanism of GQDs depends on the size of GQDs. The small GQDs (7 benzene rings) tends to insert into the inner of DNA molecules and make the base mismatch of DNA. The relative large GQDs (61 benzene rings) tends to absorb on two ends of DNA molecule and make DNA unwinding. Due to the strong absorption between guanine (G) and GQDs, the effect of GQDs is much larger on G than other three bases (A, C and T).

The aim of the presented research was to reveal the effects of SeNPs on the β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg)/d-ribose glycation system at the molecular level and explore the possible inhibitory mechanism of SeNPs on the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) by analyzing the glycation sites via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)–Orbitrap–tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Changes in contents of AGE formation and free amino acid contents had indicated that SeNPs could significantly slow the glycation process, thus attenuating the formation of AGEs.

The glycation extent of each glycation site was controlled, and the dual-glycation ability of K8, K14, K47, K91, and K101 was changed.

Here, we report the synthesis and evaluation of NanoMnSor, a tumor-targeted, nanoparticle drug carrier that efficiently codelivers oxygen-generating MnO2 and sorafenib into HCC. We found that MnO2 not only alleviates hypoxia by catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2 to oxygen, but also enhances pH/redox-responsive T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and drug release properties upon decomposition into Mn2+ ions in the TME. Moreover, macrophages exposed to MnO2 displayed increased mRNA associated with the immunostimulatory M1 phenotype. We further show that NanoMnSor treatment leads to sorafenib-induced decrease in tumor vascularization and significantly suppresses primary tumor growth and distal metastasis, resulting in improved overall survival in a mouse orthotopic HCC model.

These recent advances have made it possible to get full CI (FCI) quality results for much larger orbital active spaces compared to conventional approaches. However, due to the starting assumption that the FCI vector has only a small number of significant Slater determinants, SCI becomes intractable for systems with strong correlation. This paper introduces a method for developing SCI algorithms in a way which exploits local molecular structure to significantly reduce the number of SCI variables. The proposed method is defined by first grouping the orbitals into clusters over which we can define many-particle cluster states. We then directly perform the SCI algorithm in a basis of tensor products of cluster states instead of Slater determinants. While the approach is general for arbitrarily defined cluster states, we find significantly improved performance by defining cluster states through a Tucker decomposition of the global (and sparse) SCI vector. To demonstrate the potential of this method, called tensor product selected configuration interaction (TPSCI), we present numerical results for a diverse set of examples: (1) modified Hubbard model with different inter- and intracluster hopping terms, (2) less obviously clusterable cases of bond breaking in N2 and F2, and (3) ground state energies of large planar π-conjugated systems with active spaces of up to 42 electrons in 42 orbitals. These numerical results show that TPSCI can be used to significantly reduce the number of SCI variables in the variational space, thus paving a path for extending these deterministic and variational SCI approaches to a wider range of physical systems.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:38.653Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:38.653Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f72082ea5b0c411adfa40f6","title":"Modulation of the Innate Immune Response by Targeting Toll-like Receptors: A Perspective on Their Agonists and Antagonists","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01049","abstract":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damaged-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and they are involved in the regulation of innate immune system.

This technology exploits the intrinsic dissolution power of superbase-based ionic liquids (ILs) toward cellulose and the ability to form spinnable cellulose solutions. The regenerated fibers are produced via a dry-jet wet spinning process in which the cellulose filaments are stretched in an air gap before regenerating in an aqueous coagulation medium. For the commercialization of this process, it is essential to demonstrate the quantitative recovery of the solvent from the coagulation bath without impairing its solvation power. This study reports on the spinnability and recyclability of the IL 7-methyl-1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-enium acetate ([mTBDH][OAc]) over five cycles in comparison to 1,5-diaza-bicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-enium acetate ([DBNH][OAc]). The aqueous IL solutions were recovered from the coagulation bath by successive thermal treatments under reduced pressure. Accordingly, the recycled ILs were utilized to dissolve 13 wt % cellulose pulp in each cycle without the addition of make-up IL. While using [mTBDH][OAc], the pulp was completely dissolved and processed into easily spinnable cellulose solutions during all five cycles, whereas the ability to dissolve pulp was completely lost after the first recovery cycle when using [DBNH][OAc]. The composition of the recovered ILs and extent of side-products generated in the adopted process was analyzed in detail. This includes characterization of the rheological properties of the solutions as well as the macromolecular and mechanical properties of the regenerated fibers. In addition, we review the toxicity of both solvents using Vibrio fischeri bacteria. Finally, the spun fibers from all [mTBDH][OAc] spinning trials were combined to produce a demonstration dress (Paju), designed and sewn by Marimekko Design House in Finland.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:51.569Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:51.569Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f72083ba5b0c411adfa40f9","title":"Experiments and Direct Dynamics Simulations That Probe η2-Arene/Aryl Hydride Equilibria of Tungsten Benzene Complexes","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.0c08032","abstract":"Key steps in the functionalization of an unactivated arene often involve its dihaptocoordination by a transition metal followed by insertion into the C–H bond.

Both face-flip and ring-walk isomerizations are identified through spin-saturation exchange measurements, which both appear to operate through scission of a C–H bond. The effect of either an electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituent is to increase the stability of both arene and aryl hydride isomers. Crystal structures, electrochemical measurements, and extensive NMR data further support these findings. Static density functional theory calculations of the benzene-to-phenyl hydride landscape suggest a single linear sequence for this transformation involving a sigma complex and oxidative cleavage transition state. Static DFT calculations also identified an η2-coordinated benzene complex in which the arene is held more loosely than in the ground state, primarily through dispersion forces. Although a single reaction pathway was identified by static calculations, quasiclassical direct dynamics simulations identified a network of several reaction pathways connecting the η2-benzene and phenyl hydride isomers, due to the relatively flat energy landscape.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:51.569Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:51.569Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f72083ba5b0c411adfa40fa","title":"Tetrabromobisphenol A Perturbs Erythropoiesis and Impairs Blood Circulation in Zebrafish Embryos","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c02934","abstract":"Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, has been implicated in developmental toxicity of aquatic animals.

We demonstrated that TBBPA induced erythroid precursor expansion in the intermediate cell mass (ICM), which perturbed the onset of blood circulation at 24–26 hours postfertilization (hpf). Consequently, excessive blood cells accumulated in the posterior blood island (PBI) and vascular cells formed defective caudal veins (CVs), preventing blood cell flow to the heart at 32–34 hpf. We found that the one-cell to 50% epiboly stage was the most sensitive period to TBBPA exposure during hematopoietic development.

Biomaterial-based wound treatment approaches have progressed over time from simple cotton wool dressings to advanced skin substitutes containing cells and growth factors; however, no wound care approach is yet completely satisfying. Bioactive glasses are materials with potential in many areas that exhibit unique features in biomedical applications. Today, bioactive glasses are not only amorphous solid structures that can be used as a substitute in hard tissue but also are promising materials for soft tissue regeneration and wound healing applications. Biologically active elements such as Ag, B, Ca, Ce, Co, Cu, Ga, Mg, Se, Sr, and Zn can be incorporated in glass networks; hence, the superiority of these multifunctional materials over current materials results from their ability to release multiple therapeutic ions in the wound environment, which target different stages of the wound healing process. Bioactive glasses and their dissolution products have high potency for inducing angiogenesis and exerting several biological impacts on cell functions, which are involved in wound healing and some other features that are valuable in wound healing applications, namely hemostatic and antibacterial properties. In this review, we focus on skin structure, the dynamic process of wound healing in injured skin, and existing wound care approaches. The basic concepts of bioactive glasses are reviewed to better understand the relationship between glass structure and its properties. We illustrate the active role of bioactive glasses in wound repair and regeneration.

A structure–chemical reactivity relationship at the molecular level is believed to be useful in tuning the chemical composition of reported surrogate fuel models. This work proposes an approach to predict a component fraction of a RP-3 surrogate fuel model with a combined method of ReaxFF molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning. There are four major steps to get a refined surrogate fuel model on the basis of parent RP-3 fuel models with two, three, or four components. Step 1 helps to prepare chemical reactivity data as the input of machine learning. The chemical reactivity data are described by the oxidation reactions in terms of dynamic species concentration with time that were prepared with ReaxFF MD simulations for each derived fuel model generated from the RP-3 parent fuel model by randomly changing its component fraction. Step 2 fits a component fraction prediction model between a single surrogate component fraction and its chemical reactivity data among the common reaction space in oxidation of possible RP-3 surrogates and a 45-component RP-3 fuel with the machine-learning method. The best performance model of LightGBM was selected among the machine-learning models of linear regression, support vector regression, and LightGBM based on the training error evaluation. Each refined component fraction of RP-3 surrogate models was predicted one by one using the trained LightGBM model with the input of dynamic species concentration data of the 45-component RP-3 fuel model better representing real RP-3 fuel. Step 3 helps to select one refined surrogate model among the predicted surrogate models with two, three, or four components by comparing the chemical reactivity deviation of important species with additional ReaxFF MD simulations under the conditions of heat-up, isothermal oxidation, and isothermal pyrolysis. The optimal model of the refined three-component RP-3 surrogate is validated in step 4 where its predicted ignition delay time is found to be closer to the reported experimental data of the real RP-3 fuel than to its parent surrogate fuel model. This work suggests that the proposed computational approach by combining ReaxFF MD simulations and machine learning should be potentially useful in search for refined RP-3 chemical surrogate fuel models directly on the basis of chemical reactivity data in oxidation at the molecular level.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:51.569Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:58:51.569Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f72083ba5b0c411adfa4100","title":"Lanostane Triterpenoids with PTP1B Inhibitory and Glucose-Uptake Stimulatory Activities from Mushroom Fomitopsis pinicola Collected in North America","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c04460","abstract":"A chemical investigation on the fruiting bodies of Fomitopsis pinicola led to the isolation and identification of 28 lanostane triterpenoids including 11 new compounds (1–11) and 17 known analogues (12–28).

Two main paths, including the ANPs oxidation by H2O2 to produce H2 and Al oxides, and the catalytic decomposition of H2O2 on ANP surface to generate O2 and H2O, are confirmed to maintain the combustion. OH and HOO radicals as well as H2O, O2, H2, and Al oxides are detected as dominant intermediates and products therein.

In addition, microexplosion that has been confirmed in hot and dense O2 is not observed in H2O2, even with a high concentration, possibly due to a slower heat release.

In this formalism, most of the implemented coupling terms are built using functional forms that depend on spatial coordinates, while parameters are fitted against reference data to model the change of chemistry between the participating nonreactive states. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of such coupling terms precludes the computation of the stress tensor for condensed phase systems and prevents the possibility to carry out EVB molecular dynamics in the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble. Alternatively, we make use of coupling terms that depend on the energy gaps, defined as the energy differences between the participating nonreactive force fields, and derive a general expression for the EVB stress tensor suitable for computation. Implementation of this new methodology is tested for a model of a single reactive malonaldehyde solvated in nonreactive water. Mass densities and probability distributions for the values of the energy gaps computed in the NPT ensemble reveal a negligible role of the reactive potential in the limit of low concentrated solutions, thus corroborating for the first time the validity of approximations based on the canonical NVT ensemble, customarily adopted for EVB simulations. The presented formalism also aims to contribute to future implementations and extensions of the EVB method to research the limit of highly concentrated solutions.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:59:05.654Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:59:05.654Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f720849a5b0c411adfa410c","title":"PLL–Poly(HPMA) Bottlebrush-Based Antifouling Coatings: Three Grafting Routes","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c01675","abstract":"In this work, we compare three routes to prepare antifouling coatings that consist of poly(l-lysine)–poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) bottlebrushes. The poly(l-lysine) (PLL) backbone is self-assembled onto the surface by charged-based interactions between the lysine groups and the negatively charged silicon oxide surface, whereas the poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) [poly(HPMA)] side chains, grown by reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization, provide antifouling properties to the surface. First, the PLL–poly(HPMA) coatings are synthesized in a bottom-up fashion through a grafting-from approach. In this route, the PLL is self-assembled onto a surface, after which a polymerization agent is immobilized, and finally HPMA is polymerized from the surface. In the second explored route, the PLL is modified in solution by a RAFT agent to create a macroinitiator. After self-assembly of this macroinitiator onto the surface, poly(HPMA) is polymerized from the surface by RAFT. In the third and last route, the whole PLL–poly(HPMA) bottlebrush is initially synthesized in solution. To this end, HPMA is polymerized from the macroinitiator in solution and the PLL–poly(HPMA) bottlebrush is then self-assembled onto the surface in just one step (grafting-to approach). Additionally, in this third route, we also design and synthesize a bottlebrush polymer with a PLL backbone and poly(HPMA) side chains, with the latter containing 5% carboxybetaine (CB) monomers that eventually allow for additional (bio)functionalization in solution or after surface immobilization. These three routes are evaluated in terms of ease of synthesis, scalability, ease of characterization, and a preliminary investigation of their antifouling performance. All three coating procedures result in coatings that show antifouling properties in single-protein antifouling tests. This method thus presents a new, simple, versatile, and highly scalable approach for the manufacturing of PLL-based bottlebrush coatings that can be synthesized partly or completely on the surface or in solution, depending on the desired production process and/or application.","year":"2020","createdAt":"2020-09-28T15:59:05.654Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-28T15:59:05.654Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f720849a5b0c411adfa410e","title":"Homogeneous Polymerization of Self-standing Covalent Organic Framework Films with High Performance in Molecular SeparationHomogeneous Polymerization of Self-standing Covalent Organic Framework Films with High Performance in Molecular Separation","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.0c11022","abstract":"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are typically isolated as microcrystalline powders.

In this work, we present a data set of 61 experimental measurements of absorption and emission processes, both in the gas phase and in solvents representing a broad range of polarities, which involve intramolecular charge transfer mediated by a nonzero, “twisted” dihedral angle between one or more donor and acceptor subunits. Among a variety of density functionals investigated within the framework of linear-response theory, the “optimally tuned” LRC-ωPBE functional, which utilizes a system-specific yet nonempirical procedure to specify the range-separation parameter, emerges as the preferred choice. For the entire set of excitation energies, involving changes in dipole moment ranging from 4 to >20 Debye, the mean signed and absolute errors are 0.02 and 0.18 eV, respectively (compared, e.g., to −0.30 and 0.30 for PBE0, 0.44 and 0.47 for LRC-ωPBEh, 0.83 and 0.83 for ωB97X-V). We analyze the performance of polarizable continuum solvation models available in Q-Chem that partition the solvent response into fast and slow time scales, and clear trends emerge when measurements corresponding to the four small 4-(dimethylamino)benzonitrile (DMABN)-like molecules and a charged species are excluded. We make the case that the large errors found only for small molecules in the gas phase and weak solvents cannot be expected to improve via the optimal tuning procedure, which enforces a condition that is exact only in the well-separated donor–acceptor limit, and present empirical evidence implicating the outsized importance for small donor–acceptor systems of relaxation effects that cannot be accounted for by the linear-response time-dependent density functional theory within the adiabatic approximation.
